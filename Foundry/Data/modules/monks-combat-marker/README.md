## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
Display an animated disc behind the token that currently has a turn in the encounter.

You can add a custom image for either friendly combatants or hostile combatants.  And individually set an image for each token.  So if your players want their own design when it's their turn you can easily configure this.

You can also have a different animation for friendly combatants vs hostile combatants, just to add another way to indicate who's turn it is.

Currently the animations available are as follows:
- None, in case you have an image that is already animated.
- Clockwise
- Counter-clockwise
- Pulse
- Fade-In
- Fade-Out

You can also set the size of the underlying image, relative to the original token size, and set the animation speed.

And if you feel like the indicator gets in the way of combat, you can have it disappear once the token makes it's first move.  That way the player has an indication that they have a turn, but aren't distracted by the indicator once they begin to take their turn.

## Monk's Little Details

This feature was previously part of the Monk's Little Details module, but was split out so that the modules were easier to maintain and could concentrate on the function they did best.
