# Monk's Hotbar Expansion
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT

This is an update to the standard Hotbar to expand and show all rows on the Hotbar on the screen at the same time.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
Pressing the page number on the standard Hotbar will expand all Hotbar rows, and allow you to drag and drop on any of the rows.
It will allow you to directly pick the row you wish to see by clicking the number beside the expanded rows, rather than paging to it.
And clicking the trash can will allow you to clear an entire row of macros.

## Known Issues
Dragging between macros on the expanded bars isn't working.  I'm not sure why.
