# Monk's Player Settings
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
Allow the GM to view and edit the player settings and sync client settings between browsers.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features

### Viewing and editing player settings

When you open the Configure Game Settings dialog, you'll see a drop down with all the players names listed.  Switching to a player will refresh the settings with the client settings for that player.  And editing those settings and saving will update the players settings.  If the player is currently logged in, the settings will be immediately applied, otherwise the settings will be updated the next time the player logs in.  If the settings being changed require the browser to be refreshed, a warning dialog will be displayed letting the player know that they'll need to refresh for the settings to take effect.

Please note that a player will need to have logged in first for the settings to be displayed accurately.

### Syncing settings between browsers

Client settings are stored with the browser so if you switch to a different browser you'll lose those settings.  Monk's Player Settings will keep a copy of the most recent settings that were saved and on a different browser, will prompt you to sync with those saved settings.

You can turn this off in the settings if you don't want to sync, and don't want to be bothered by the warning.

### Limitations

Player settings can only be gathered and triggered from the Settings Config dialog.  Modules like Simple Calendar, that allow you to edit settings outside of the core Foundry settings editor can not be tracked.
