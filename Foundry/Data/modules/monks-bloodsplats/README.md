# Monk's Bloodsplats
Display dead creatures as bloodsplats to keep the battlefield clear of tokens.  Bloodsplats are generated randomly per creature and show when the creature has a dead or defeated status.  With options to change the colour and transparency of the blood splat, either individually or per world.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
When an Monster is killed, show it as a blood splat rather than the icon.  This can eliminate a bit of clutter on the screen and makes it easier to see what's going on.

The GM will always be able to see the token through the bloodsplat, and by default the player will only see the bloodsplat, but this is configurable in the settings if you'd rather the players see the token aswell.

You can also change the transparency, relative size, and colour of the bloodsplat.  And update a token with individual bloodsplat colours.

## Monk's Little Details

This feature was previously part of the Monk's Little Details module, but was split out so that the modules were easier to maintain and could concentrate on the function they did best.
