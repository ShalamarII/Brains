Uses a modification of the Spell Arrow Spell (M65).
He can enchant bullets, which he can only shoot from his own gun. The gun is attuned to his unique signature and can be re-attuned by him to other people. 

### Enchantment Steps

1. Use the Imbue verb + Magic noun to prepare an imbuement (At Base, this costs 4). This will succeed unless you fail the spell check or for an additional reason (Anti-Magic Field, Fatigue Over-Use, etc.)
2. Find the cost of the spell itself (Speak with DM about it in advance, I can help with creating them on a whim as well.) \[See example below]
3. Find the Modifiers of the spell (Range, Duration, Casting Time)
4. Pay the Spells Cost (Verb + Noun + FP Cost)
5. Roll against the spell (Magery \[Syntactic Magic]  - Verb Realm Level +/- Additional Modifiers)
6. If the spell succeeds, you successfully imbue the spell into the bullet. 

### Example
Imbuing the spell Create Fire (2 + 2 Cost) assuming Amadeus has a Thaumatology skill of 12 and a Magery level of 4.
In this case Amadeus wants to create a fire-based exploding bullet.

1. Use 4 Mana and 3 FP to begin the imbuement process.
2. *Create Fire* in this case will be interpreted like the spell ***Explosive Fireball***
3. There is no modifiers (Range, Duration, Casting Time).
4. Pay the amount to cast the spell (2 + 2 = 4 + 3 FP)
5. The Realm Level of the *Create* verb is 3 so the roll is Thaumatology Skill (12) + Magery Level (4) - Realm Level (3) + Other modifiers, (12+4-3 = 13) So the roll we need is a 13 or less.
6. The Roll was successful! You now have 1 spell bullet!!!

##### Totals Spent

8 Mana, 6 FP
Roll (13 or less)

Not the best huh. But if we add modifiers we immediately get a better result. To make the imbuement affect 6 bullets we simply add a selective modifier of +50% for each additional bullet (+250% total). So for 20 mana, we can enchant 6 bullets with the explosive fireball enchantment in.  To make it even easier, we can 20x the cast time (4 Seconds x 20 = 80 Seconds) to reduce the cost of the imbuement down to 10 mana, which is manageable without breaks.

Fatigue Point Replacement:

For the same 6 bullets, 20x the cast time, then instead of spending 6 FP, we decide to use an additional +120% mana to cast it. This brings our total to 12 mana, but does not use any FP.
