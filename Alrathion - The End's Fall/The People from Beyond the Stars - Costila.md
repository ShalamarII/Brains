The Costila (Costilians) are the creators of [[The Horizon Project]], a sub-universe creation. They are tall beings, with (Space) suits they wear at all time.

### The Suits
The suits allow the Costila people to live, as they are too weak to survive the increased gravity of the universe. They emigrated to the district they live in now, so they cannot survive the pressure. These suits help decompress their bodies, providing vital nutrients to the person's body (This is meant to be a direct parallel to the Tira family).

### Their Work on The Horizon Project
As the creators of The Horizon Project, they funneled resources and time into ensuring its growth. Many of the Costila people regard the Horizon as a chance for their own rise to power.
