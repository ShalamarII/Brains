## Introduction
***Flow Comes First.*** Let's play a game where things get done.
- We'll keep rule arguments to a minimum, stick to rulings where possible.
- If you have a hard time with focus, try keeping notes.
- Have your dice out, your character sheet available. Knowledge of your sheet is of utmost importance for you.

***Immersion is King.*** Let's play a game where people are immersed.
- Respect the scene. Keep meta talk to a minimum.
- Respect the characters. Don't joke when people are roleplaying.
- Respect the ignorance. Artless exposition might be worse than focused ignorance.
- Respect the player. Players can ask for what they need, don't volunteer it unprompted.
