Magic and science are one in the same in Alrathion. The distinction between the two is the belief of its origin. Magic's believed origin are the Gods' (Those of which are believed to exist). Science's believed origin is man.

The truth is a bit more muddy. Belief in a God by its followers is their source of energy. The name of those God's are The Troi. The Troi are more similar to a battery, of which belief is the charge. Their plane is known as (INSERT NAME HERE). Their world is a similar technology level as Alrathion. Unfortunately, rarely can the Troi affect the world of Alrathion, making God's more belief based.

To gain more power, Troi's can also influence the people of Alrathion to combine their understanding of a God, causing the followers to be split among the two Troi.
