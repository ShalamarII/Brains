- A family that casts using pressurized heating vestibules (Loading and Chambering) in their body, allowing them to immediately cast (Flowy combat style) (Elbows and Other areas for it) (Repercussions being dead tissue around the areas) (Has own form of body-enhancing, though flawed) Different Clothing (Bone Size is lessened)
- Windmill Kick as a move

### Natural Evolution
This family evolved to more easily bend their joints and contort their bodies, allowing for attacks seldom seen by other's. They also have more resilient bones, which allows them to not shatter when they move very quickly.

### Pressure Module
Using a module to pressurize blood separates its formulation, de-aerating it, artificially making it blue on use, but red after a given period of time. The bodies of the Pudt Family naturally pressurizes itself, with an inbuilt mechanical system. One vestibule is completed every minute, granted that they have been used. Each person can have up to 5 vestibules, with more possible due to further modification (Though extremely dangerous). This means the choice of vestibule is very important.
