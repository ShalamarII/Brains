## Valves

This family uses valves to allow spell-blood to flow through their veins. This means they cannot use combat focused spells, only enhancing their own properties.

## Reliance on True Blood

People of this family have to pump true blood back through their veins in a process known as The Restoration. They put their blood into a centrifuge that separates the blood from the contaminant. They then pump that blood back into their body.
