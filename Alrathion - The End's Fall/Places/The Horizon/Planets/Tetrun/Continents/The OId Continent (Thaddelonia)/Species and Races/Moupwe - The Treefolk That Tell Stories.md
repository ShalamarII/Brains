Borne of the forest, these are the people who walk amongst the trees. They have a limited ability to share their senses with trees around them.

### The Great Story
The Moupwe think that stories are our way of connecting with history, and that everything has a story. As such, they travel in packs, collecting stories from the trees around them. They inscribe these memories in tomes, bound of their own bark and sap. These books naturally contain the essence of the creator in them. 

### The Idra Hunt
The Idra hunt the Moupwe because of their tomes, as they contain innate (magical) power. By using these tomes, they gain greater natural agility, quickness of though, and strength. The Menari protect them for this reason. 

### Menari | Heart-Trees
The Moupwe help upkeep the Menari's Heart-Trees in exchange for the protection they receive. Thusly, it is not uncommon to see 3-5 Menari traveling with the Moupwe. The Heart-Trees are like good friends to the Moupwe people.

### The Great Book

The Great Book contains the tribes history themselves. They are a part of the Heart-Trees, a staple of the Moupwe people. The Heart-Trees are originally created by the Moupwe in conjunction with La'Hamar. Each Heart-Tree has a portion of the Great Book, and they are created when the knowledge is passed between Heart-Trees (See [[The Awakening]])

##### Attack of the Idra
The Idra have ramped up their attacks, under the leadership of the Sveltegarde (Holsfang will win regardless of the party's help). Many of the tribes leaders have had their tomes taken and used by Holsfang. The party must stop them before the Idra drive the Moupwe to ruin.   

##### The Fusion of The Locket and The Great Book
^major-hook
When the [[Menari - The People of Nature#^8475f9 |Locket of La'Hamar]] and the [[#The Great Book]] fuse, they show a chart of the stars. This chart can then bring them to planets marked upon them, but must absorb energy to be recharged. The only planet the map will have access to from the start is the planet Vularis (Home of the Troi). 

### Vularis Hooks

##### The Ancestors of the Moupwe

The ancestor of the Moupwe is a "God" from the planet of Vularis. She discovered the other planets, and devised methods of travel between them. The Star Chart is an object of her and La'Hamar's creation.
