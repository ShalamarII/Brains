### Description

The Veilroot Tuber is an elusive plant found in areas of deep solitude, where nature thrives undisturbed. It has an almost sentient quality, seeking out wounded or exhausted creatures, wrapping its gentle, tendril-like roots around them and subtly restoring their vitality. Many travelers have woken up in the woods feeling mysteriously refreshed, unaware that a Veilroot had cradled them in their sleep.

Due to its unique properties, consuming the Veilroot induces a strange, tingling numbness that spreads throughout the body. This effect is temporary but can be disorienting if unprepared. Strangely, when refined into a potion, the tuber grants temporary invisibility—but with an unusual side effect: the user emits a soft, ethereal glow, making stealth a rather paradoxical endeavor.

### Behaviors

- Grows in secluded areas, often near ancient, untouched groves.
- Seeks out fallen creatures and wraps them in gentle, pulsing roots.
- Thrives in solitude, withering if planted too close to other tubers.

### Effects When Ingested

- Causes a temporary numbness or tingling sensation throughout the body.
- Provides a subtle boost in energy and vitality.
- When used in alchemy, grants temporary invisibility, but the user glows faintly.

### Potion Name

**"Phantom's Embrace"**

### Potion Effects

- Grants temporary invisibility for several minutes.
- Leaves behind a faint, shimmering glow that lingers even in darkness.

### Potion Lore

Phantom’s Embrace is a favorite among illusionists, spies, and mischievous tricksters who prefer mystery over true stealth. Legends tell of a thief who drank this potion to evade capture—only to leave behind a glowing trail, leading his pursuers straight to him. Despite its flaw, those who master its use can become haunting specters, vanishing into the night while leaving behind a whisper of light.

##### Fun Fact

Some scholars believe the Veilroot is more than just a plant—ancient myths claim it to be the remnant of a long-lost guardian spirit, forever seeking to aid weary travelers in need.
