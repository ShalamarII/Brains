### Description

The **Boar Hut Fern** is a resilient, spiky-leaved plant that thrives in shaded, woodland environments. Its green, fern-like fronds grow in thick clusters, resembling the bristly mane of a wild boar—hence its name. While its aroma carries a subtle chalky quality with a faint floral hint, its true appeal lies in its sweet, delicate flavor.

This plant is unique in that its leaves must be harvested carefully to preserve their taste. When cut from the stalk while still attached to the stem, the leaves retain their bright green color and natural sweetness. However, if improperly plucked, they lose both their color and flavor, rendering them bland and useless for culinary purposes.

Boar Hut Fern is prized in traditional cooking, particularly in the making of **Puto**, a soft, steamed rice cake where its sweetness enhances the dish’s natural flavor. The leaves can also be incorporated into confections, breads, or even ice creams, providing a subtle, natural sweetness that elevates simple recipes.

### Behaviors

- Turns brown quickly when cut incorrectly, indicating a loss of flavor.
- Retains its color and sweetness only when harvested properly.
- Prefers cool, shaded forest environments with high humidity.

### Effects When Ingested

### Potion Lore

Beloved by traveling bards and weary adventurers, **Verdant Essence** is often sought after for its subtle energizing properties. Many claim that a sip of this potion can turn even the blandest meal into a feast, sharpening the senses and enhancing flavors with an almost magical effect. Some old folktales even suggest that the plant’s sweetening abilities were a gift from forest spirits, ensuring that no lost traveler would ever go hungry with bland rations.

##### Fun Fact

Boar Hut Fern is sometimes nicknamed "The Baker’s Fern" because early confectioners would use its leaves to naturally sweeten their dough before refined sugar became widely available.
