### Description

The Starveil Lichen is a mystical organism found in the twilight hours of dense, enchanted forests and hidden glades. Its presence is often associated with a feeling of serenity, as it emits an unseen pheromone that eases worries and soothes troubled minds. However, those who handle it carelessly may find their skin reddened and irritated, as its cool surface contains subtle alchemical compounds that interact strangely with flesh.

Beyond its calming effects, Starveil Lichen harbors a peculiar magic—when consumed or even touched in large quantities, it causes the affected person to shrink to the size of an insect for a brief period. This effect has led to myths of tiny travelers using the plant to explore the unseen worlds beneath the roots and within the petals of flowers.
