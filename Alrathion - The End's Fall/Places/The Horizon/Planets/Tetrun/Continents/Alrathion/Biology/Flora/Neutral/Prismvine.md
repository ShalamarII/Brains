### Description

The **Prismvine** is a peculiar and captivating plant known for its enigmatic response to music. Often found weaving through ancient ruins or thriving in places with deep cultural history, this vine appears almost sentient, shifting and trembling in response to melodies. Its leaves are delicate but lively, curling and uncurling as if absorbing the energy of nearby sounds.

What truly sets the Prismvine apart, however, is its ability to translate music into visible, flowing streams of color. A bard’s song may cause soft ribbons of blue and green light to ripple through the air, while a frantic drumbeat could send bursts of red and gold crackling like sparks. This trait has made the vine highly sought after by performers and illusionists, who use it to enhance their performances with breathtaking displays of color.

Though often admired for its beauty, consuming the Prismvine comes with unpredictable consequences. While pickling the vine tempers its potency, those who ingest it may experience strange side effects ranging from mild bloating to uncontrollable hallucinations of light, sound, and shape.

##### Fun Fact
