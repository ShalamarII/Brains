*My family was taken from me at a young age. I watched a serpent eat them and I wept, tearlessly. I was taken to an orphanage, a boy naught of 10. I grew up hearing about the hero my daddy was, how he was a great leader. In that moment, I'd decided what I wanted to be. A protector of those weaker than myself.  I've made my way here, a council member, seeking to protect those that are weak and afraid.; and I will continue.  I will protect those that cannot protect themselves. Along with my fellow council members, we will make this country fairer, safer, and more prosperous!!!*
