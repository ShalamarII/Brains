> [!InalaGreatCouncil] Inala Dostravi
 A tall, slender Kathali, she seems to be of a bird people. She is 6'5, standing the highest of all of The Great Council. She is very bubbly, curious about science above all. She views the Troi as a specimen to be researched, often toeing the line to gauge their reactions, goals, etc.

>[!MonraGreatCouncil] Monra Franta
> Despondent and detached, Monra is a Kathali who has seen war. She looks like a large bear with white and black fur. She is a descendent of a great clan, and while being trained in her youth her clan was attacked by the [[History to Mining, Accessibility and Economics|People of Illinea.]] She vowed since that day to understand their magic, and one day bring this empire crumbling at the knees.
