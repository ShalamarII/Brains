The tale of the Kathali people’s origins is one marked by the passing of generations, the fall of ancient nations, and the forging of new identities. The discovery of their descent from the Menari people is tied closely to the tumultuous period known as the **Great War**.

### The Great War & The Illinea Empire's Exodus

Long ago, the **Menari**, a proud and deeply spiritual people, thrived across the wetlands of their homeland, living in harmony with nature and worshipping La-Hamar, the god who had gifted them life through the healing powers of the land. They were a peaceful people but not without their own unique power—deep knowledge of nature's magical flow, and a deep belief that emotions and the cycles of life intertwined to create a deep, mystical connection with the world around them.

When the **Illinea Empire**, a vast and powerful civilization, fell into disarray during the **Great War**, many of the Empire’s most prominent figures and citizens fled their homeland, searching for new lands to conquer and cultivate. In their wake, the Illinea Empire left behind many peoples, including the **Menari**—who had shared a complex, yet longstanding relationship with the Empire.

However, in the chaos of the war, the **Menari** and their deep bonds with nature were largely abandoned. The Illinea Empire's leaders, in their haste to escape impending doom, made a decision to take some of the Menari with them, hoping to bring their magical prowess to the new lands.

The chosen Menari people were selected not only for their wisdom but for their unique ability to harmonize with the land’s magic. These chosen few were transported across a vast and dangerous sea to a newly discovered continent, **Alrathion**. There, the Illinea Empire sought to use the Menari’s talents to bolster their power and ensure a smooth transition into this new territory. But **Alrathion** was not a place of simple conquest—its lands were rich with wild magic and ruled by ancient beings, and it held a long and secret history. The Menari’s arrival would not go unnoticed.

### The Rise of the Kathali

While the **Illinea Empire** sought to exploit the powers of the Menari people, the reality of colonization was far harsher than anticipated. Over time, the land of **Alrathion** took its toll on the settlers. As the **Illinea Empire’s** influence began to wane, the Menari who were brought to Alrathion began to change, adapting to the new, foreign environment in ways that even the Illinea could not have foreseen.

Centuries of isolation and exposure to a harsh, unpredictable environment led to the evolution of the **Kathali** people. These Menari descendants found themselves physically altered, their once purely human forms becoming imbued with beastlike features, granting them greater strength and endurance. It is believed that this transformation was both magical and biological, with their adaptation to the land deeply influencing their forms. Over the course of generations, the Kathali began to embrace these changes, viewing them as blessings rather than curses, further distancing themselves from their ancestors.

As these descendants evolved, they began to develop their own unique culture, distinct from their Menari predecessors. The core values of **honesty**, **family**, and **balance** that would come to define the Kathali way of life grew from the Menari's earlier philosophies, but with a renewed focus on strength, unity, and survival in an often unforgiving world.

### The Exodus and the Kathali's Transformation

The **Kathali**, though still connected to their Menari ancestors through magic and bloodline, began to forge their own path. The gradual separation between the two peoples came when the **Kathali** made a deliberate break with their **Menari** roots. As the Illinea Empire fell further into decline, and with the rise of new powers within Alrathion, the Kathali people felt a powerful sense of loss—loss of their connection to their original homeland, and the abandonment of the traditions that once defined their way of life. Many Kathali, seeing themselves as different from the Menari, moved further into isolation, fearing the encroachment of the remaining Imperial forces.

For generations, the Kathali have kept their **ancestral grudge** against the **Illinea Empire**, especially against the **Elven** descendants who remained behind on their ancient lands. The bitterness of being torn from their homelands and thrust into a foreign world festers still, though many Kathali now live without the same fury that once burned in the hearts of their ancestors.

Through it all, the **Kathali** have remained tied to the earth and its cycles, finding a new kind of balance in their ways. They no longer see themselves as the same people that once walked with the **Menari**—instead, they see themselves as guardians of a new order. Their **beastlike transformations** and deep connection to the natural world now define them more than the magic of their ancestors ever did.

### Legacy of the Menari and the Kathali People

Today, the **Kathali** understand the **Menari** only through **songs**, **lore**, and ancient rituals—those same rituals that were passed down from their ancestors, often altered and adjusted through generations of separation. The old **song of La-Hamar** lives on, sung by the Kathali in rituals of healing, but it has taken on new meanings, tied to their own culture.

Though the **Kathali** people have become a distinct race with their own unique identity, they still honor their roots in the **Menari**—from their reverence for nature to their respect for the ties that bind them. It is said that on quiet nights, if one listens closely, the wind will carry an ancient **Hul'Ka** song—whispers of a long-lost people, reminding the Kathali of the past, of their Menari ancestors, and of the trials they have overcome to become what they are today.
