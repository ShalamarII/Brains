The kathali are a race that look similar to humans, but noticeably shorter, with even the tallest ones being around 5'8". They tend to grow quite a bit slower than humans, reaching adult physical maturity at the age of 30, and having a lifespan up to 180 years.

> The kathali hold honesty and truth as one of their highest virtues, being blunt, and generally unbending about the truth. This causes them to scrutinize things much more often, which shows in their work. 

##### Family

A kathali's greatest honor is their own family, often seeking to create better for the following generations, and do as well as possible for their own families. For them, leaving their family is one of the biggest choices they can make, and as such, their loyalty to their new family is top notch.

It takes much for a kathali to abandon their family, to the point where humans suspects are more likely to be persecuted than the kathali.

##### Balance

The kathali believe that balance is important. To exemplify this, they make sure to justify their own beliefs in a way not unlike humans.  This justification is not inherently more factual than human's own. Part of balance is history for the kathali. Their parents teach them their history much more intentionally than the human's generally do, and as such, kathali may be aware of even 5-10 generations back.
