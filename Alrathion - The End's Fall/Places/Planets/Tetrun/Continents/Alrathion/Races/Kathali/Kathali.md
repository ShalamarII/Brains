The kathali are a race that look similar to humans, but with beastlike features. They tend to grow quite a bit slower than humans, reaching adult physical maturity at the age of 30, and having a lifespan up to 180 years.

## **Values**

These are the values of the Kathali people, having held them for a multitude of years.

### Honesty

The kathali hold honesty and truth as one of their highest virtues, being blunt, and generally unbending about the truth. This causes them to scrutinize things much more often, which shows in their work. 

### Family

A kathali's greatest honor is their own family, often seeking to create better for the following generations, and do as well as possible for their own families. For them, leaving their family is one of the biggest choices they can make, and as such, their loyalty to their new family is top notch.

It takes much for a kathali to abandon their family, to the point where humans suspects are more likely to be persecuted than the kathali.

### Balance

The kathali believe that balance is important. To exemplify this, they make sure to justify their own beliefs in a way not unlike humans.  This justification is not inherently more factual than human's own. Part of balance is history for the kathali. Their parents teach them their history much more intentionally than the human's generally do, and as such, kathali may be aware of even 5-10 generations back.

### **Rite of Passage: The Journey of the Spirit**

Upon reaching adulthood at the age of 30, Kathali undergo a sacred ceremony called the **Journey of the Spirit**. This event marks their official entry into adulthood and is deeply spiritual. The young Kathali must embark on a personal journey that could last anywhere from a few days to several months, depending on their inner struggles and the guidance they seek. The journey often takes them to ancestral lands or remote sacred sites, where they reflect, meditate, and reconcile with their past. The Rite of Passage symbolizes the Kathali's transition into adulthood, and the completion of it marks them as "true adults" in the eyes of their people.

### **The Clan Tree**

Family and lineage are incredibly important to the Kathali, and they maintain a living, ever-expanding symbol of this bond called the **Clan Tree**. It is a massive tree in the heart of each village or settlement, where each family carves its symbol into the bark as they are born into the community. The roots of the Clan Tree run deep through history, with the most ancient trees containing carvings from generations upon generations. The Clan Tree is also used as a place for formal discussions and decision-making, where all matters of honor, justice, and loyalty to the family are debated.

### **Honor of the Ancestors**

Kathali place significant value on their ancestral heritage. They believe their ancestors are always watching, and their spirits guide and influence decisions made in the present. **Shrines to the Ancestors** are found in every home, and many Kathali will make offerings of food, incense, or small tokens to them before major decisions. During the high holy seasons, the Kathali gather in great feasts to honor the accomplishments and deeds of their ancestors, where stories of past heroics and wisdom are recited, often in a ceremonial performance.

### **The Path of Balance**

The Kathali follow a strict code known as **The Path of Balance**, where they try to ensure harmony within themselves, with others, and with nature. The Path is not a rigid set of rules but a constant quest for equilibrium. They practice physical disciplines such as martial arts or balance-based meditation, which help them maintain their internal equilibrium. In social life, the Path calls them to listen as much as they speak, carefully considering both sides of any argument or issue before making a decision. This cultural facet extends to nature, where Kathali strive to keep a balance in hunting, gathering, and resource management, ensuring they never take more than they need.

### **The Council of Elders**

Leadership among the Kathali is not based on strength alone, but on wisdom and experience. The **Council of Elders**, consisting of the most respected members of society (often those who are 100 years or older), serves as the governing body of any settlement. They make decisions regarding law, warfare, trade, and family matters. These elders are chosen based on their ability to provide balanced counsel and their deep understanding of history. Disputes among younger Kathali are often brought to the council, and it is said that no matter how passionate a debate might get, the council's decisions are always fair, as they consult both their own wisdom and the teachings of the ancestors.
