### Description:
The Boar Hut Fern is a green fern, that has a rose-like smell, though more chalky. The leaves turn a brown color when cut from the stalk, though retaining the color if the plant is cut from the stem. The Boar Hut Fern has a sweet taste, with its leaves adding a pleasant taste to breads, confections, and ice cream. It is best eaten plain, with the leaves carefully peeled from the stalk AFTER cutting the plant from its stem. If done incorrectly, the plant lacks flavor. It is often used to make puto, a steamed rice cake, with the fern giving it its signature sweetness.
