There are multiple organizations seeking to do the best for the population. The most powerful of these is The Great Council.

### The Great Council

This is a group of highly influential beings, seeking to protect their own interest firstly and the people of Alrathion secondly. They are the only beings of Alrathion that are in contact with the Troi. They are composed of one representative from each magical family and 2 representatives that are "for the people".
They hold the highest authority in the country.

##### Communication with the Troi
It is taxing for even the most powerful of the Troi to communicate with The Great Council. Thusly, they only send short messages, rarely communicating for long periods of time. Their first communication like this as it were in 30 years is about the theorems/information that the children provide to their teachers. They are instructed to kill them and the teachers that they had, as to stop leakage of the information. This starts off the campaign, as the children are abandoned, left to die.
