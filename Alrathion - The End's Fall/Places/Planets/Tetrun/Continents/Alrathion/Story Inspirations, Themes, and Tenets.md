##### Cultural and Societal 
Magical schools are family-based, being extremely prejudiced, even to the rich. Approximately 1/50000 educated kids get in and only ***extremely*** rarely are commonfolk allowed in.
- When you attend a magical institution that teaches Aimasturgy you are actually leaving your family to join the magical families’
- Many people die in the practicum of Aimasturgy or become an ersatz (Users that lose their sanity or core traits as a result of tainted blood). In the extraordinary cases, those people are offered resources. 
- Pride of One’s country is relatively non-existent for the magical as magically-established families are semi-nomadic, expected to spread their influence throughout the world. This results in the magically-established families being akin to nation-states of their own, further portrayed by their moving cities.
##### Magical and Mystical
- Discovery within controlled bounds
- Gained artifacts from the Old Continent
