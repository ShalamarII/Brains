The Idra are people of solitude. Left behind, they became their own, each living as a family alone. Nomads, wanderers, explorers, whatever you want to call them, they are strong. They hold no grudge, but simultaneously only prioritize self-preservation. 

### The Hunt
The Idra have naturally adapted to hunting, becoming more muscular, with lean bodies. Hunting is not a sport, but their very lifeblood. The Idra are in tune with their intuition, receiving a 6th sense, often used for detecting danger. 

### Family Rituals
Each family of the Idra have their own symbol used to distinguish these families. They rarely teach them to outsiders, and this is reserved for benefactors and the like. The families are called "packs"

### Mating Rituals
The men keep a bone necklace as a trophy, meaning their kills can be directly counted. The woman will come close and touch his necklace, indicating her interest. The man will then touch her hair, if it is soft, then she can hunt and take care of herself well, if it is rough the man would need to do more work. This does not necessarily mean that she will not be pursued, but that he knows what work he will have to do.

### Allegiance Again
In the past 50 years, there has been a faction growing among the Idra. They are the family Sveltegarde, a family who seeks to bring the Idra back together again. They have two main leaders, Holsfang and Thorss. Holsfang wants to unite the land under his fist, and his tactics resemble such. Thorss is a much more calculated person, seeking the best for his people.

There are 3 main symbols they have, one being 3 fingers over the thumb (with both thumbs and pinkies touching), the second being the same but the index fingers are touching, and the third being the same with the pinkies down. They are Sweltegarde, Thorss, and Holsfang respectively. Most people will utilize the main symbol, and then use their factionary symbol as a marker of true trust.

The Sveltegarde family is constantly seeking outsiders, and the party can join them for a cost.
