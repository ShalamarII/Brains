The Menari people are the ancestors to the [[Kathali]]. They were the second largest nation at the time of [[The Great War]]. When the people of the Illinea Empire fled, the Menari were left behind. This has caused a grudge that the Menari people still carry to this day. 

The Menari's language is called Hul'Ka (Hool Ka)

### Culture
The Menari are a kind people, enjoying and exalting the cycle of nature above all. Knowledgeable of the world around them, they have been surviving for a long time. Despite this, they managed to increase their magical prowess, taking a more natural approach to magic.  They often use their blood to catalyse the world around them, taking a far less science based path than the Illinea people. Despite this, they are strong, teaching that emotions are your nature too.

Practicians use songs when they are healing, singing the story of La-Hamar, their patron.
### Locket of La-Hamar (la hɑ'mʌr).

Long ago, there was a boy with bright green eyes. He was frail, whos' mother died in the birth of her child. This boy was joyful, despite his circumstances. He'd often talk and sing with the plants around him, finding hope in their vines. He lived in peace with the tribe, exploring often, finding solace with his plants; until one day, he was attacked by a wild boar, that left him impaled through his chest. In his last moments, he began to pray to nature; and nature listened. A vine grew up from the earth and replaced the heart of the boy, giving him new life and reinvigorating him. The plants wrapped around him, healing him and entwining his nature with theirs. So the boy was saved.
