# General Overview
Vraul is the universe's lifeblood. Magic is a matter of your power over it.

There are three core aspects of any creation; mind, body, and spirit. Vraul is the linker between a spirit, the mind, and the body. Things do not necessarily need all 3, but often do have all 3. Plant life contains mind and body, without spirit. Apparitions contain mind and spirit, but without body. Automatons may contain body and spirit, but not mind.

### Neutrality. Purpose.
Being as such, Vraul has no express purpose. When a purpose is expressed, that Vraul shapes itself in the best way to communicate that purpose. Do not get this confused with things being perfect, or even the best. This means that whatever the user communicates is emulated. Like an artist: if you draw poorly, your audience will not be able to fully understand or exemplify your vision. The way Vraul emulates this is with a temperament. 

### Impulses
Impulses are the blocks, or principles that the universe uses to shape Vraul. I will use elements as examples, because though often closely related, they are not directly bound to them.  Some things are more easily communicated to the universe, such as Destruction. 

Destruction is commonly associated with Fire. 
Resilience is commonly associated with Earth.
Tranquility is commonly associated with Water.
Flexibility is commonly associated with Air.
Wildness is commonly associated with Nature.
Control is commonly associated with Law.
Emptiness is commonly associated with Space.
Good is commonly associated with Light.
Evil is commonly associated with Darkness.

Time is immutable. It cannot be affected, as it itself is the container that holds Vraul.

Destruction is skewed towards affecting the body of a given creation, even though it can be applied to all 3 aspects. 

### Mind Opener
"What is fire? It it the ignition? It it the light it gives off? is it all of those and more? Just as we cannot truly define fire, we cannot truly define anything. We can only prescribe categories upon it. Nothing is stopping a fire from lacking light. We can only think it does."

### Creation
Impulses are often used together, but there is often a main, and a secondary impulse. Swapping them does not simply reverse a spell. Fire usually has a Destructive tendency as its main tendency, but you can replace it with Tranquility. If you do, you may notice a fire that may not burn, or a fire that lasts longer than it would normally.

### Communication
How well you can communicate your will through Vraul is the most significant part of magic. Those that do not have a fully realized plan/usage for their magic but can communicate better see results.
