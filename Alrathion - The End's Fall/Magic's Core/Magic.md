# General Overview
Vraul is the universe's lifeblood. Magic is a matter of your power over it.

There are three core aspects of any creation; mind, body, and spirit. Vraul is the linker between a spirit, the mind, and the body. Things do not necessarily need all 3, but often do have all 3. Plant life contains mind and body, without spirit. Apparitions contain mind and spirit, but without body. Automatons may contain body and spirit, but not mind.

### Neutrality. Purpose.
Being as such, Vraul has no express purpose. When a purpose is expressed, that Vraul shapes itself in the best way to communicate that purpose. Do not get this confused with things being perfect, or even the best. This means that whatever the user communicates is emulated. Like an artist: if you draw poorly, your audience will not be able to fully understand or exemplify your vision. The way Vraul emulates this is with a temperament. 

# Magery

Magery is based on your knowledge of Realms.
##### Levels
Level 1: Detection and Measurement. This is much the same as level 1 in the three-level system discussed above, but strictly limited to passive sensing.
Level 2: Control and Diversion. The magician has limited control over anything that falls within the Realm. This includes the ability to encourage its natural growth and to calm it, but not to create it or suppress it much below its natural level. Weather/2 might allow a ship’s wizard to save the vessel from being blown onto rocks by turning the winds around a few points, and maybe stopping them from growing much worse, but the ship would still have to run before the wind until it blows itself out. Objects can only be reshaped within their natural limits, although perhaps a little faster than usual; wood warps naturally, so Plants/2 could make a door twist loose from its frame in a few minutes. Likewise, ghosts are always bound by rules and restrictions, so it’s not hard for a wizard with Necromancy/2 to create a barrier that prevents them from entering a room. If a force or a power permeates the entire universe, then level 2 in the associated Realm permits its exploitation in straightforward ways. The magician’s person and identity may be easier to manipulate than something external; Health/2 might, with GM permission, let the user heal his own minor wounds, but not regenerate lost limbs or help others. 
Level 3: Command and Simple Creation. With substantial control over the Realm on a local level, the magician can call up things that might exist, make them go away, repair them, or change their appearance or capabilities. This also permits the creation of simple manifestations of the Realm. The GM decides what’s “simple,” but while a lightning bolt or a rock should qualify, and a tree or an insect might, a living person certainly won’t. Humanity/3 might, however, grant the ability to heal (or inflict) wounds, influence someone else’s emotions and thoughts, and cause the nearest human beings to approach. Likewise, Motion/3 could grant the power of flight, or Magic/3 could enable the user to dispel most other magics by suppressing their magical nature. 
Level 4: Authority. Anything that lies within the Realm is open to command, and the magician can create all but the most complex manifestations of this aspect of reality. He can also negate use of lesser levels of the same Realm by commanding that working’s subject not to be affected. Decay/4 might let him not only cause the destruction of anything that’s subject to decline (living or not), but also make something that has already decayed work “as new” by suppressing all consequences of the decay. Biology/4 might enable him to change the sex of living things, make them physically older or younger, or grant them special abilities borrowed from other, similar species. 
Level 5: Complete Power. At this level, the magician’s control of the Realm appears more-or-less complete. He can turn it off or on, perform the most radical transformations (although he may need access to another Realm for this; e.g., turning a tree into a horse might require not only Plant/5 but also Animal/4), or create the most complex forms from nothing (albeit still subject to any fundamental rules of magic concerning permanent creations). He can also remove or change individual features of the target, often in complex ways. For example, Image/5 might permit him to make someone appear to be a man to one observer, a horse to another, and invisible to a third – simultaneously. 
Level 6: Transcend Limitations. This is a legendary level of power over the Realm, achieved by few mortals. It could be nothing more than a wild rumor, or achieving it may be the lifetime ambition of every wizard. The GM is free to require large Unusual Backgrounds for PCs who wish to attain it. Essentially, an expert can adjust the nature of the Realm itself, at least locally. Energy/6 might permit a magician to turn electricity into a purple liquid, while Love/6 might make indifference into the highest expression of love. Primarily, though, level 6 in a Realm is the point at which anything is possible – temporarily, and if the GM approves. The potential dangers of such power are as great as the benefits.

### Impulses (Verbs)
Impulses are the blocks, or principles that the universe uses to shape Vraul. I will use elements as examples, because though often closely related, they are not directly bound to them.  Some things are more easily communicated to the universe, such as Destruction. 

Destruction is commonly associated with Fire. 
Resilience is commonly associated with Earth.
Tranquility is commonly associated with Water.
Flexibility is commonly associated with Air.
Wildness is commonly associated with Nature.
Control is commonly associated with Law.
Emptiness is commonly associated with Space.
Good is commonly associated with Light.
Evil is commonly associated with Darkness.

Time is immutable. It cannot be affected, as it itself is the container that holds Vraul.

Destruction is skewed towards affecting the body of a given creation, even though it can be applied to all 3 aspects.

Air-1 would allow you the ability to communicate with and sense air.

### Mind Opener
"What is fire? It it the ignition? It it the light it gives off? is it all of those and more? Just as we cannot truly define fire, we cannot truly define anything. We can only prescribe categories upon it. Nothing is stopping a fire from lacking light. We can only think it does."

### Creation
Impulses are often used alone, with the structure of 1 impulse 1 aspect creating the vast majority of spells. Swapping them does not inherently reverse a spell. Fire usually has a Destructive tendency as its main tendency, but you can replace it with Tranquility. If you do, you may notice a fire that may not burn, or a fire that lasts longer than it would normally.

### Communication
How well you can communicate your will through Vraul is the most significant part of magic. Those that do not have a fully realized plan/usage for their magic but can communicate better see results. 

### Grimoires
As vraul can be used to imbue something, mages can have a grimoire. To do this, they must encode a spell with their own understanding of it. To use someone else's encoded spell, they must roll a thaumatology or appropriate realm roll. The result is based on the following table:

| 4+              You decipher and make the spell your own. You may inscribe the spell into your grimoire and cast it at a later date (Which takes 1d days) or you may cast it without a penalty to roll for 1d days.  or  |
