Blood is composed of three things, its type, its Vraul and its attunement. 

### Type
Blood type is crucial when creating formulae, as they must be adjusted for the blood's type.

### Vraul
Vraul is the inherent energy with one's own blood. It can be utilized to create magical effects, whether throughout spells (Discovered newly) or through Formulae. The Troi have a greater understanding of Vraul than the people of Alrathion, which is partially why they can obtain power through the [[Magic vs. Science|Imbuement]]
process.
