They have created magic as it is known in the world of Troi, a casting system outside of their own bodies. This scares the Troi, who do not want their power too be challenged. Magic being inexplicably tied to the body was standardized in concept due to the Troi, as a method of keeping the people of Alrathion in check. They would do anything in their power to keep this knowledge away from the world. They utilize the Great Council as a means of control, as they are generally impotent to affect the world directly.
