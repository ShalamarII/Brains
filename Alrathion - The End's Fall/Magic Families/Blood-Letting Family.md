### Hosting a Parasite

This family has a parasite given to them at the age of 4 that feeds off their nutrients but produces a mineral that is forced into the bloodstream. This mineral has beneficial effects to the user. When an older person(s) utilizes the parasite, it attempts to make these changes all at once, feeding on the large amount of stored True-Blood. This can cause death, and is a major obstacle in people's joining of this family.

### Contamination

This parasite slowly contaminates the userâ€™s Blood, requiring bloodletting to keep the blood pure. This is done by simply taking vials and refilling them. Utility-wise, they are able to refill their vials about twice a day, but they must blood-let at least once a week. As the family has progressed they have evolved to have quicker blood creation and flow.

# Mineral's Effects

### Healing

- The mineral can allow healing of others as the negative effects can be counter-acted. This process is called Refining. It usually leaves patients with a dreamy feeling, caused by the positive effects of the mineral.

### Poison

- The mineral can also be used as a poison as you have to build up a tolerance over time. This is why children are exposed to the parasite early on. The poisonous effects are shown similarly to a stimulant, with the person feeling an increase of energy until they eventually succumb to the poison.

# Occupations

- In their youth, Blood-Letters choose a path, whether healing or destruction.
