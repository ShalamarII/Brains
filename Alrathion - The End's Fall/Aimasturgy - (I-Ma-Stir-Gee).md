What I want from this system:

- Strict Hierarchy based on strength in institutions (Meritocracy) (Youth can be higher ranked, and it is based off achievements) (You must challenge people in organizations officially, making brawls a spectacle and more rare.)
- Exile from family is not receiving your families covenant, therefore making life much harder when traveling, doing things that could use magic’s QoL (Have to delve into this more), etc.
- The Forsaken are beings who use magic but do not augment their blood (Forbidden but not always evil. Magic is considered a treasure and to use ones body is to discover something uniquely human)
- Augmenting one’s blood to be used for magic formulae is the basis of the system, blood holds the substance Vraul (as in brawl)
- Discovery of a new method of magic is the greatest honor for a novitae (User of magic \[Sanctioned])
- Magic is alchemically based, but Vraul has many usages.

What arises from this system:

- Magical schools are family-based, being extremely prejudiced, even to the rich. Approximately 1/50000 educated kids get in and only extremely rarely are commonfolk allowed in
- When you attend a magical institution that teaches Aimasturgy you are actually leaving your family to join the magical families’
- Many people die in the practicum of Aimasturgy or become an ersatz (Users that lose their sanity or core traits as a result of tainted blood)
- Pride of One’s country is relatively non-existent for the magical as magically-established families are semi-nomadic, expected to spread their influence throughout the world. This results in the magically-established families being akin to nation-states of their own, further portrayed by their moving cities.
- Families take pride in “honorable” magic (A magic they refined and passed down throughout the generations)

What are repercussions of this system:

### Economic
### Social
### Cultural

Magical Combat is based on burning one’s health (Blood) to catalyse spells.

Wards can be created by targeting a user's Vraul signature (Unique to the blood augmentation).

Cities move along the leylines of the world, following a predictable path.
