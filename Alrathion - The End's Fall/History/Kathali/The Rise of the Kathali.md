While the **Illinea Empire** sought to exploit the powers of the Menari people, the reality of colonization was far harsher than anticipated. Over time, the land of **Alrathion** took its toll on the settlers. As the **Illinea Empireâ€™s** influence began to wane, the Menari who were brought to Alrathion began to change, adapting to the new, foreign environment in ways that even the Illinea could not have foreseen.

Centuries of isolation and exposure to a harsh, unpredictable environment led to the evolution of the **Kathali** people. These Menari descendants found themselves physically altered, their once purely animal forms becoming imbued with beastlike features, granting them greater strength and endurance. It is believed that this transformation was both magical and biological, with their adaptation to the land deeply influencing their forms. Over the course of generations, the Kathali began to embrace these changes, viewing them as blessings rather than curses, further distancing themselves from their ancestors.

As these descendants evolved, they began to develop their own unique culture, distinct from their Menari predecessors. The core values of **honesty**, **family**, and **balance** that would come to define the Kathali way of life grew from the Menari's earlier philosophies, but with a renewed focus on strength, unity, and survival in an often unforgiving world.
