The **[[Kathali]]**, though still connected to their [[Menari (Menari Multuk) |Menari]] ancestors through magic and bloodline, began to forge their own path. The gradual separation between the two peoples came when the **[[Kathali]]** made a deliberate break with their **[[Menari (Menari Multuk) |Menari]]** roots. As the Illinea Empire fell further into decline, and with the rise of new powers within Alrathion, the [[Kathali]] people felt a powerful sense of loss—loss of their connection to their original homeland, and the abandonment of the traditions that once defined their way of life. Many [[Kathali]], seeing themselves as different from the [[Menari (Menari Multuk) |Menari]], moved further into isolation, fearing the encroachment of the remaining Imperial forces.

For generations, the [[Kathali]] kept their **ancestral grudge** against the **Illinea Empire**. The bitterness of being torn from their homelands and thrust into a foreign world festers still, though most [[Kathali]] now live without the same fury that once burned in the hearts of their ancestors.

Through it all, the **[[Kathali]]** have remained tied to the earth and its cycles, finding a new kind of balance in their ways. They no longer see themselves as the same people that once walked with the **[[Menari (Menari Multuk) |Menari]]**—instead, they see themselves as guardians of a new order. Their **humanlike transformations** and deep connection to the natural world now define them more than the magic of their ancestors ever did.
