### The Great War & The Illinea Empire's Exodus

Long ago, the **Menari**, a proud and deeply spiritual people, thrived across the wetlands of their homeland, living in harmony with nature and worshipping La-Hamar, the god who had gifted them life through the healing powers of the land. They were a peaceful people but not without their own unique power—deep knowledge of nature's magical flow, and a deep belief that emotions and the cycles of life intertwined to create a deep, mystical connection with the world around them.

When the **Illinea Empire**, a vast and powerful civilization, fell into disarray during the **Great War**, many of the Empire’s most prominent figures and citizens fled their homeland, searching for new lands to conquer and cultivate. In their wake, the Illinea Empire left behind many peoples, including the **Menari**—who had shared a complex, yet longstanding relationship with the Empire.

However, in the chaos of the war, the **Menari** and their deep bonds with nature were largely abandoned. The Illinea Empire's leaders, in their haste to escape impending doom, made a decision to take some of the Menari with them, hoping to bring their magical prowess to the new lands.

The chosen Menari people were selected not only for their wisdom but for their unique ability to harmonize with the land’s magic. These chosen few were transported across a vast and dangerous sea to a newly discovered continent, **Alrathion**. There, the Illinea Empire sought to use the Menari’s talents to bolster their power and ensure a smooth transition into this new territory. But **Alrathion** was not a place of simple conquest—its lands were rich with wild magic and ruled by ancient beings, and it held a long and secret history. The Menari’s arrival would not go unnoticed.
