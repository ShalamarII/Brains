Today, the **Kathali** understand the **Menari** only through **songs**, **lore**, and ancient rituals—those same rituals that were passed down from their ancestors, often altered and adjusted through generations of separation. The old **song of La-Hamar** lives on, hummed by the Kathali in rituals of healing, but it has taken on new meanings, tied to their own culture.

Though the **Kathali** people have become a distinct race with their own unique identity, they still honor their roots in the **Menari**—from their reverence for nature to their respect for the ties that bind them. It is said that on quiet nights, if one listens closely, the wind will carry an ancient **Hul'Ka** song—whispers of a long-lost people, reminding the Kathali of the past and of the trials they have overcome to become what they are today.
