Many civilization begin trying to conquer large areas, with better armor, stronger tools, and better infra structure. Many of these civilizations have primitive versions of Aimasturgy.
Illinea does this as well, gradually assimilating more and more cultures into their own. They become the dominant force of the Thaddelonia Continent.

This continues until the Great War, in which 90% of the population was eradicated, after the Troi supported Illinea. The last bastions of these people moved into the continent of Alrathion.
