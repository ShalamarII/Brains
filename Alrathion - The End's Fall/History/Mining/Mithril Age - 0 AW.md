Mithril is finally able to be processed, though expensive to do so. Mithril is a similar hardness to tempered iron (steel). People do not yet understand its usefulness, and so it is relegated to serve mainly a decorative purpose. Players will notice mithril as a vessel for vraul, with the ability to hold its shape. They will be the pioneers of wands, staffs, etc. that are capable of holding spells for longer than one use.
