“Going once. Going twice. Sold to the lad in the grey hat!”

The crowd turned to him, his arm up as far as he could reach.

“Congratulations sir. After the auction, come backstage and receive your prize!”

He sighed in relief, a monster of emotions building up inside him.

The rest of the auction went by in a blur, item after item being sold, fought for silently but intensely.

“Thank you all for coming, can all the buyers please come to the stage after the intermission period.”

He waited until all the other buyers had left, telling the usher where to take their spoils.

At last, it was time.

He began to walk towards the backstage, each step resounding through the relatively empty hall.

As he got closer to the partially closed curtain, his breathing started to get heavier, panic setting in.

He approached a podium near the stage, where an usher was standing with the buyer’s list.

“Your name sir?”

“Alec Bwendle.”

The man checks his notepad, searching carefully for his name.

“Where did you want it delivered?”

“I’ll take her with me now.”

“It really is customary for the buyers to have them-”

“I’ll take her now.”

“I see, right this way sir.”

The usher led Alec through a messy backstage with relics, art pieces, and paraphernalia of all kinds until they arrived at a small cage containing a young woman.

Beaten and battered, she looked up with fearful eyes.

The usher inquired whether Alec needed anything else, handing him the key.

Alec walked towards the woman, placing his hand upon her cage and unlocking it.


Chapter One


“Who… are you?” The girl squeaked out, on their way towards the front.

“Alec.”

He grabbed her by the arm and took out a pair of handcuffs.

“Put these on.”

She reeled away from the handcuffs, fear showing on her face.

“It’s just for now. I’ll take them off you when we get to the car, I promise.”

She hesitantly grabbed the handcuffs and put them on, making sure to leave them as loose as possible.

They then walked to stage area.

They made their way back to the usher.

"Dispose of the cage please."

“Yes sir. I’ll have that taken care of immediately.”

“Let’s go.”

They made their way to an old station wagon.

“Wait in the car, I have to make a call.”

Alec pulled out a piece of paper from his jacket, reading it over while dialing the numbers.

He heard a scruff voice from the other end.

“Was she there?”

“Yes. The payment has already been wired and a bonus will be sent accordingly.”

“Alright boss. Thanks for the dough. Good luck.”

“Tell Pam I said hi.”

Alec hung up the phone and got in the driver's seat.
Alec walked around to the driver’s side and opened the door.
“First time in a station wagon?”

Alec looked into the back seat where the woman had fallen asleep from exhaustion.

## Chapter Two

Alec pulled the station wagon into a long driveway, pressing a button at the top and opening the garage.

\*** Insert Story to get them to eat \***

“Try it, I’m sure you’ll like it.”

Georgia puts her bowl out and waits for Alec to ladle some soup for her. She then takes a small sniff of it, and it smells somewhat sour. She tastes it and wrinkles her nose.

“Is it not to your taste?” Deborah asks her, mouth slightly parted.

“Yes, it’s good. I’ve never had anything this sour before. At least not recently.” Georgia’s eyes rise to meet Alec’s. Do you remember when we would go to Grandpa’s and eat sour candies?”

“Of course I do. You were extremely eager to get them, but would always wrinkle your nose.”
