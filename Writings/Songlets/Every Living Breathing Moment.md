For just one moment I wanted to see.

You are weak, my son. But that is true strength.

Why does nothing change? Why am I the same person today and yesterday and forever. I can't do this anymore.

Art is the miracle we give to one another. It is the hope that binds, the truth that ties us to one another.

To leave them behind, I had to leave a part of myself, too.

I have to fight, what don't you see? It's me in that ring. It's you, it's him, it's everyone! We're all fighting, all the time. I wish everything would just ***stop***.
