I am an extension of the staff. I lend it my senses to feel its own. I have to conceptualize what I will do with the sword or else it may not work correctly. 
Method: 

Roll for Conceptualization: D100

Supreme Grade Sword

### Downside:
I lose all my senses. I feel the damage of it coming from my sword. If I do something "evil", I gain malice. If I gain 4 stacks, I become insane. 

1-2 Malice: No negative effects
2-3: Malice: Roll for being stunned
4: Go insane, which gives me 3 levels of exhaustion and causes me to become bloodthirsty

I can feel a powerful pressure coming into the sword from me. 
Spells that I have in it can be used once per short rest.

1 spell that has to stay in it forever

3 mechanical slots that can be changed out between my inventions.

Current mechanical slots:
- Spear version
- Katana version
- Flail

Slots I can create:
- Bow transformation
- 

Long Rests lose me 2 stacks of malice.

### Flashback from Brimbsley

The sword rejected and tried to kill him. 

The area where the weapon is from, and who gave it to him is blocked. 

The name of the weapon is Ashura's Hand.
