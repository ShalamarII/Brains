### Introduction
- Founded 2020
- Worked Finance, Sales, Automobile, Made a Small Catholic School.

### What is Networking
- Networking is the process of making connections and building relationships. These connections can provide you with ***advice and contacts***, which can help you make informed career decisions. Networking can help you find ***unadvertised jobs/internships***.

### What is our Challenge
##### Education is Not Enough
Even with identical credentials, first-generation graduates have more trouble getting jobs than their better coached peers.

##### Fun Facts
- 85% of jobs are found through Networking.
- 70% of professionals get hired at companies where they already have a connection.
- Around 75% of people don't get anything back.

##### AI is not as useful as you think
Human connection is more important because of AI's influence.
