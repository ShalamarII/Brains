## General Overview

Four numbers called “attributes” define your basic abilities: Strength (ST), Dexterity (DX), Intelligence (IQ), and Health (HT). ***A score of 10 in any attribute is free, and represents the human average.*** 

Higher scores cost points: 10 points to raise ST or HT by one level, 20 points to raise DX or IQ by one level. Similarly, scores lower than 10 have a negative cost: -10 points per level for ST or HT, -20 points per level for DX or IQ. (Remember that negative point values mean you get those points back to spend on something else!) Most characters have attributes in the 1-20 range, and most normal humans have scores in the 8-12 range. Scores above 20 are possible but typically reserved for godlike beings – ask the GM before buying such a value. At the other end of the scale, 1 is the minimum score for a human. The basic attributes you select will determine your abilities – your strengths and weaknesses – throughout the game.


| Attribute Score | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1               | ***Weak beyond compare.*** 1 is the minimum score for a human.                                                                                            |
| 6 or less       | ***Crippling.*** An attribute this bad severely constrains your lifestyle.                                                                                |
| 7               | ***Poor.*** Your limitations are immediately obvious to anyone who meets you.                                                                             |
| 8 or 9          | ***Below average.*** Such scores are limiting, but within the human norm.                                                                                 |
| 10              | ***Average.*** Most humans get by just fine with a score of 10!                                                                                           |
| 11 or 12        | ***Above average.*** These scores are superior, but within the human norm.                                                                                |
| 13 or 14        | ***Exceptional.*** Such an attribute is immediately apparent – as bulging muscles, feline grace, witty dialog, or glowing health – to those who meet you. |
| 15 or more      | ***Amazing.*** An attribute this high draws constant comment and probably guides your career choices.                                                     |
| 20+             | ***Godlike.*** Scores above 20 are possible but typically reserved for godlike beings – ask the GM before buying such a value.                            |

## Main Attributes

[[#Strength (ST)]]
[[#Dexterity (DX)]]
[[#Intelligence (IQ)]]
[[#Health (HT)]]
#### Strength (ST) 
***±10 points/level***
Strength measures physical power and bulk. It is crucial if you are a warrior in a primitive world, as high ST lets you dish out and absorb more damage in hand-to-hand combat. Any adventurer will find ST useful for lifting and throwing things, moving quickly with a load, etc. Strength is more “open-ended” than other attributes; scores greater than 20 are common among beings such as large animals, fantasy monsters, and robots.

> [!NOTE] Basic Lift (BL)
> Basic Lift is the maximum weight you can lift over your head with one hand in one second. It is equal to (ST\*ST)/5 lbs. If BL is 10 lbs. or more, round to the nearest whole number; e.g., 16.2 lbs. becomes 16 lbs. The average human has ST 10 and a BL of 20 lbs.
> 
> Formula: (ST$^2$) / 5  = Basic Lift in lbs.

#### Dexterity (DX) 
***±20 points/level***
Dexterity measures a combination of agility, coordination, and fine motor ability. It controls your basic ability at most athletic, fighting, and vehicle-operation skills, and at craft skills that call for a delicate touch. DX also helps determine Basic Speed (a measure of reaction time, p. 6) and Basic Move (how fast you run, p. 6)
#### Intelligence (IQ) 
***±20 points/level***
Intelligence broadly measures brainpower, including creativity, intuition, memory, perception, reason, sanity, and willpower. It rules your basic ability with all “mental” skills – sciences, social interaction, magic, etc. Any wizard, scientist, or gadgeteer needs a high IQ first of all. The secondary characteristics of Will (p. 6) and Perception (p. 6) are based on IQ.
#### Health (HT) 
***±10 points/level***
Health measures energy and vitality. It represents stamina, resistance (to poison, disease, radiation, etc.), and basic “grit.” A high HT is good for anyone – but it is vital for low-tech warriors. HT determines Fatigue Points, and helps determine Basic Speed (p. 6) and Basic Move (p. 6).

## Secondary Attributes

[[#Handedness]]
[[#Basic Lift (BL)]]
[[#Hit Points (HP)]]
[[#Will]]
[[#Perception (Per)]]
[[#Fatigue Points]]
[[#Basic Speed (BSPD)]]
[[#Basic Move]]
[[#Damage (Dmg)]]

#### Handedness 
Decide whether you are right-handed or left-handed. Whenever you try to do anything significant with the other hand, you are at -4 to skill. This does not apply to things you normally do with your “off” hand, like using a shield. GURPS doesn’t distinguish between left- and right-handed characters; either is 0 points. However, Ambidexterity is an advantage that costs points – see p. 8.
#### Basic Lift (BL)
Basic Lift is the maximum weight you can lift over your head with one hand in one second. It is equal to (ST\*ST)/5 lbs. If BL is 10 lbs. or more, round to the nearest whole number; e.g., 16.2 lbs. becomes 16 lbs. The average human has ST 10 and a BL of 20 lbs.

Formula: (ST$^2$) / 5  = Basic Lift in lbs.

#### Hit Points (HP)
***±5 points/±1 level***
Your body’s ability to sustain injury. You have HP equal to your ST. For instance, ST 10 gives 10 HP

#### Will 
***±5 points/±1 level***
Will measures your ability to withstand psychological stress (brainwashing, fear, hypnotism, interrogation, seduction, torture, etc.) and your resistance to supernatural attacks (magic, psionics, etc.). Will is equal to IQ. Will does not represent physical resistance – buy HT for that!

#### Perception (Per)
***±5 points/±1 level***
Perception (Per) represents your general alertness. The GM makes a “Sense roll” against your Per to determine whether you notice something. Perception equals IQ.

#### Fatigue Points (FP)
***±3 points/±1 level***
Fatigue Points (FP) represent your body’s “energy supply.” You have FP equal to your HT. For instance, HT 10 gives 10 FP.

#### Basic Speed (BSPD)
***±5 points/±0.25 level***
Basic Speed is a measure of your reflexes and general physical quickness. It helps determine your running speed, your chance of dodging an attack, and the order in which you act in combat (a high Basic Speed will let you “out-react” your foes). To calculate Basic Speed, add your HT and DX together, and then divide the total by 4. Do not round it off. A 5.25 is better than a 5!

Formula: (HT + DX) / 4 = BSPD


> [!NOTE] Dodge
> Your Dodge defense (see Dodging, p. 28) equals Basic Speed + 3, dropping all fractions. For instance, if your Basic Speed is 5.25, your Dodge is 8. You must roll under your Dodge on 3d to duck or sidestep an attack.

#### Basic Move
***±5 points/±1 yard/second***
Basic Move is your ground speed in yards per second. This is how fast you can run (although you can go a little faster if you “sprint” in a straight line; see p. 23). Basic Move starts out equal to Basic Speed, less any fractions; e.g., Basic Speed 5.75 gives Basic Move 5. An average person has Basic Move 5; therefore, they can run about 5 yards per second if unencumbered.

#### Damage (Dmg) 
Your ST determines how much damage you do in unarmed combat or with a melee weapon. Two types of damage derive from ST: Thrusting damage (abbreviated “thrust” or “thr”) is your basic damage with a punch, kick, or bite, or an attack with a thrusting weapon such as a spear or a rapier. Swinging damage (abbreviated “swing” or “sw”) is your basic damage with a swung weapon, such as an axe, club, or sword – anything that acts as a lever to multiply your ST. 

Consult the following table for your basic damage. This is given in “dice+modifier” format. 

| ST  | Thrust | Swing |
| :---: | :-----: | :-----: |
|  1  |  1d-6  | 1d-5  |
|  2  |  1d-6  | 1d-5  |
|  3  |  1d-5  | 1d-4  |
|  4  |  1d-5  | 1d-4  |
|  5  |  1d-4  | 1d-3  |
|  6  |  1d-4  | 1d-3  |
|  7  |  1d-3  | 1d-2  |
|  8  |  1d-3  | 1d-2  |
|  9  |  1d-2  | 1d-1  |
| 10  |  1d-2  |  1d   |
| 11  |  1d-1  | 1d+1  |
| 12  |  1d-1  | 1d+2  |
| 13  |   1d   | 2d-1  |
| 14  |   1d   |  2d   |
| 15  |  1d+1  | 2d+1  |
| 16  |  1d+1  | 2d+2  |
| 17  |  1d+2  | 3d-1  |
| 18  |  1d+2  |  3d   |
| 19  |  2d-1  | 3d+1  |
| 20  |  2d-1  | 3d+2  |

Damage is sometimes abbreviated “Dmg.” On your character sheet, list thrust followed by swing, separated by a slash; e.g., if you had ST 13, you would list “Damage 1d/2d-1.”
