### General Overview
When you roleplay, you take the part of another person – a “character” that you create. GURPS lets you decide exactly what kind of hero you will become. Asteroid miner? Wizard? Professional time-traveler? You can take your inspiration from a fictional hero or heroine, or create your new “self” from the ground up. Once you know what role you want to play, it’s time to bring that character to life! 
The GM (Game Master – the person “running” the game) will give you a number of character points with which to “buy” your abilities. For instance, the stronger you want to be, the more points it will cost. You can also buy advantageous social traits, such as wealth, and special abilities called advantages (see p. 8). If you want more abilities than you can afford on the budget given to you by your GM, you can get extra points by accepting below-average strength, appearance, wealth, social status, etc., or by taking disadvantages – specific handicaps such as bad vision or fear of heights (see p. 10). 
The two most important things to know about your character are who they are and what role you want them to play in their adventures. Find out what kind of game the GM plans to run and what kinds of characters they intend to allow. Then start filling in the details. There are several ways to approach this. You can choose the abilities you want, spend your character points, and work out a character concept that fits the abilities. A good character is much more than a collection of abilities, but “shopping” for abilities can be a great inspiration. You might instead decide on your character’s focal qualities first – the handful of things that define them, such as personal history, appearance, behavior, aptitudes, and skills. Think about how they acquired those qualities, then spend your points on features that go with these traits.
