### General Overview
At the end of each session, the GM may award bonus character points for good play; these are the same kind of points you used to create your character. Bonus points are used to develop and improve your character. Record them as “unspent” on your character sheet. Then spend them the same way as during character creation, as follows: 

To improve one of your basic attributes, you must spend character points equal to the point-cost difference between the old score and the new one. Note that improving basic attributes will also affect secondary characteristics! 

Most advantages are inborn, and cannot be “bought” later on. Exceptions include Combat Reflexes and languages, which can be learned, and social advantages like Status, which can be earned (in some societies). To add an advantage, you must pay the appropriate character points. 

A character may get rid of most beginning disadvantages by buying them off with points equal to the bonus earned when the disadvantage was taken, as long as the player and GM can agree on a logical explanation for this. 

Earned character points can be used to increase your skills or add new ones. When you improve a skill, the cost is the difference between your current skill level and the cost of the new skill level.

### Bonus Character Points
At the end of each play session, the GM should award bonus character points for good play. “Good play” is anything that advances the heroes’ mission or shows good roleplaying – preferably both. But roleplaying trumps mission success! If a player did something totally outside his character’s personality (for instance, if a total coward performed a brave act), this should not be worth any points, even if it saved the day for the rest of the group! 

The GM is free to award any number of points . . . but in general, they should give each player between zero and five points, averaging two or three points, per session. The GM might also wish to give an award – perhaps equal to that for a successful play session – upon the conclusion of a lengthy adventure, story arc, or major plot thread.
