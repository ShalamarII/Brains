### General Overview
A “quirk” is a minor personality trait. It’s not an advantage and it’s not necessarily a disadvantage – it’s just something unique about your character. For instance, a major trait like Greed is a disadvantage. But if you insist on being paid in gold, that’s a quirk. You may take up to five quirks at -1 point apiece . . . and if you do, you will have five more points to spend. You can also “buy off” a quirk later on by paying 1 point, but as a rule, you shouldn’t do that. Quirks might have a small cost, but they are a big part of what makes a character seem “real”! Mental Quirks are minor personality traits. However, you must roleplay them. If you take the quirk “Dislikes heights,” but blithely climb trees and cliffs whenever you need to, the GM will penalize you for bad roleplaying. To qualify as a mental quirk, a personality trait must meet one of two criteria: It requires a specific action, behavior, or choice on your part from time to time; or it gives you a small penalty very occasionally, or to a narrow set of actions. Physical Quirks are physical disadvantages that are only mildly or rarely limiting. They do not require roleplaying, but they give specific, minor penalties in play.
