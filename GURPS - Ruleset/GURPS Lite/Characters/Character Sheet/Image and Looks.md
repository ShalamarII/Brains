### General Overview
This defines your character’s intrinsic “social” traits: appearance, manner and bearing. Traits with positive point values (e.g., above-average Appearance, Voice) are considered advantages (p. 8), and obey all the usual rules for advantages. Others (e.g., below-average appearance, Odious Personal Habits) have negative values, and are treated as disadvantages (p. 10). Still others (e.g., height and weight, handedness) merely add “color.”

### Appearance
Appearance is mostly a “special effect” – you may choose any physical appearance you like. Appearance is rated in levels. Most people have “Average” appearance, for 0 points. Good looks give a reaction bonus; this is an advantage and costs points. Unappealing looks give a reaction penalty; this is a disadvantage, and gives you back points. See the table below for the bonuses.

| Appearance Level                  | Description                                                                                                                     | Reaction Roll Bonus                | Points |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| Hideous                           | You have any sort of disgusting looks you can come up with: a severe skin disease, wall-eye, preferably several things at once. | -4                                 | -16    |
| Ugly                              | As above, but not so bad – maybe only stringy hair and snaggle teeth.                                                           | -2                                 | -8     |
| Unattractive                      | You look vaguely unappealing, but it’s nothing anyone can put a finger on.                                                      | -1                                 | -4     |
| Average                           | The default level. Most people have Average appearance.                                                                         | 0                                  | 0      |
| Attractive                        | You don’t enter beauty contests, but are definitely good-looking.                                                               | +1                                 | 4      |
| Handsome (or Beautiful)           | You could enter beauty contests.                                                                                                | +4 (attracted people), +2 (others) | 12     |
| Very Handsome (or Very Beautiful) | You could win beauty contests – regularly.                                                                                      | +6 (attracted people), +2 (others) | 16     |

## Image Based Advantages/Disadvantages
### Charisma
***±5 points/level***
You have a natural ability to impress and lead others. Anyone can acquire a semblance of charisma through looks, manners, and intelligence – but real charisma is independent of these things. Each level gives +1 on all reaction rolls made by sapient beings with whom you actively interact (converse, lecture, etc.); +1 to Influence rolls (see Influence Rolls, p. 24); and +1 to Leadership and Public Speaking skills. The GM may rule that your Charisma does not affect members of extremely alien races.

### Odious Personal Habits
***-5, -10, or -15 points***
You usually or always behave in a fashion repugnant to others. An Odious Personal Habit (OPH) is worth -5 points for every -1 to reaction rolls made by people who notice your problem. Specify the behavior when you create your character, and work out the point value with the GM. Examples: Body odor, constant scratching, or tuneless humming would give -1 to reactions, and are worth -5 points apiece. Constant bad puns or spitting on the floor would give -2 to reactions, worth -10 points apiece. We leave -15-point habits (-3 to reactions) to the imagination of those depraved enough to want them!
### Voice
***10 points***
You have a naturally clear, resonant, and attractive voice. This gives you +2 with any skill that depends on speaking or singing (with the GM’s approval, of course). You also get +2 on any reaction roll made by someone who can hear your voice.
