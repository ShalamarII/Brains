### General Overview
A “skill” is a particular kind of knowledge; for instance, karate, physics, auto mechanics, or a death spell. Every skill is separate, though some skills help you to learn others. Just as in real life, you start your career with some skills and can learn more if you spend time training. A number called “skill level” measures your ability with each of your skills: the higher the number, the greater your skill. For instance, “Shortsword-17” means a skill level of 17 with the shortsword. When you try to do something, you (or the GM) roll 3d against the appropriate skill, modified for that particular situation. If the number you roll is less than or equal to your modified score for that skill, you succeed! But a roll of 17 or 18 is an automatic failure. For more on skill rolls, modifiers, success, and failure, see p. 2.

### Controlling Attribute
Each skill is based on one of the four basic attributes. Your skill level is calculated directly from this “controlling attribute”: the higher your attribute score, the more effective you are with every skill based on it! If your character concept calls for many skills based on a given attribute, you should consider starting with a high level in that attribute, as this will be most cost-effective in the long run. ST-based skills depend wholly on brawn, and are very rare. DX-based skills rely on coordination, reflexes, and steady hands. IQ-based skills require knowledge, creativity, and reasoning ability. HT-based skills are governed by physical fitness.

### Difficulty Level
Some fields demand more study and practice than others. GURPS Lite uses three “difficulty levels” to rate the effort required to learn and improve a skill. The more difficult the skill, the more points you must spend to buy it at a given skill level. Easy skills are things that anyone could do reasonably well after a short learning period. Average skills include most combat skills, mundane job skills, and the practical social and survival skills that ordinary people use daily. Hard skills require intensive formal study or training.

| Skill Type | Description                                                                          | Examples                               | Notes                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Easy       | Skills that most people can learn and perform reasonably well with minimal training. | Basic physical tasks, simple crafts    | Quick to learn and apply.             |
| Average    | Common skills requiring moderate training or experience, often used in daily life.   | Combat, job skills, social interaction | Practical and broadly applicable.     |
| Hard       | Skills needing extensive formal study, practice, or specialized expertise to master. | Advanced sciences, complex techniques  | Demands significant effort and focus. |

This table is for calculating your B.S. (Basic Skill) for each skill, based on its difficulty.

| Skill Level | Skill Level | Skill Level | B.S.        |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Easy        | Average     | Hard        |             |
| –           | –           | –           | Attribute-3 |
| –           | –           | 1           | Attribute-2 |
| –           | 1           | 2           | Attribute-1 |
| 1           | 2           | 4           | Attribute+0 |
| 2           | 4           | 8           | Attribute+1 |
| 4           | 8           | 12          | Attribute+2 |
| 8           | 12          | 16          | Attribute+3 |
| x+4         | x+4         | x+4         | Extra+1     |
X is your skill level to qualify for the extra bonus once reaching 8/12/16 for Easy/Average/Hard respectively

### Technological Skills
Certain skills are different at each tech level (see Technology Level, p. 7) and are designated by “/TL.” When you learn such a skill, you must learn it at a specific tech level (TL). Always note the TL when you write down such a skill. Navigation/TL2 (consult the stars and an astrolabe) is nothing like Navigation/TL8 (get your location off a GPS receiver). You learn technological skills at your personal TL. You may also choose skills from a lower TL. You can only learn skills from a higher TL in play – and only if you have a teacher and the skill is not based on IQ. To learn IQ-based technological skills from a higher TL, you must first raise your personal TL.

## Buying Skills
In order to learn or improve a skill, you must spend character points. When you spend points on a skill, you are getting training to bring that skill up to a useful level. Skills are easy to learn at first – a little training goes a long way! But added improvement costs more.

The point cost of a skill depends on two things: its difficulty and the final skill level you wish to attain. Use the Skill Cost Table (above) to calculate a skill’s point cost. The first column shows the skill level you are trying to attain, relative to the skill’s controlling attribute – DX for DX-based skills, IQ for IQ-based skills, and so forth. For instance, if your DX were 12, a level of “Attribute-1” would be DX-1, or 11; “Attribute+0” would be DX, or 12; and “Attribute+1” would be DX+1, or 13. The next three columns show the character point costs to learn skills of different difficulties – Easy, Average, and Hard – at the desired skill level. Harder skills cost more points to learn!

## Skill Defaults: Using Skills You Don't Know
Most skills have a “default level”: the level at which you use the skill if you have no training. A skill has a default level if it is something that everybody can do . . . a little bit. As a general rule, a skill defaults to its controlling attribute at -4 if Easy, -5 if Average, or -6 if Hard. Some skills have no default level. For instance, Karate is complex enough that you cannot use it at all without training.

##### The Rule of 20
If a skill defaults to a basic attribute that is higher than 20, treat that attribute as 20 when figuring default skill. Superhuman characters get good defaults, but not super ones.

##### Who Gets a Default?
Only individuals from a society where a skill is known may attempt a default roll against that skill. For instance, the default for Scuba skill assumes you are from a world where scuba gear exists and where most people would have some idea – if only from TV – of how to use it. A medieval knight transported to the 21st century would not get a default roll to use scuba gear the first time he saw it!

# Skill List
### General Overview
The skill list is sorted alphabetically by skill name. Each entry gives the following information: Name: The skill’s name. 
Technological skills are noted as such; e.g., “Mechanic/TL.” 
Type: The skill’s controlling attribute and difficulty level; e.g., “IQ/A.” 
E stands for Easy, A for Average, and H for Hard. 
Default: The attribute to which the skill defaults if you haven’t studied it. “None” means no default – you cannot attempt to use the skill if you don’t know it. 
Description: An explanation of what the skill is for and how it works in play.

| Influence Skills         | Various         | Various | There are several ways to influence others; each is a separate influence skill. A successful roll will result in a good reaction from an NPC. Failure results in a bad reaction (except for Diplomacy, which is relatively safe). To actually coerce or manipulate an NPC, you must win a Quick Contest of your skill versus his Will. Methods of influencing others include: <br><br><h5>Diplomacy (IQ/H)</h5><br>Negotiation and compromise. Defaults to IQ-6. <br><br><h5>Fast-Talk (IQ/A)</h5><br>Lying and deceit. Defaults to IQ-5. <br><br><h5>Intimidation (IQ/A)</h5><br>Threats and violence. Defaults to IQ-5. <br><h5>Savoir-Faire (IQ/E)</h5><br>Manners and etiquette. Mainly useful in “high society” situations. Defaults to IQ-4. <br><h5>Sex Appeal (HT/A)</h5><br>Vamping and seduction, usually of the opposite sex. Defaults to HT-3. <br><h5>Streetwise (IQ/A)</h5><br>Contacts and (usually) subtle intimidation. Only useful in “street” and criminal situations.

| Interrogation            | IQ/A            | IQ-5    | This is the ability to question a prisoner. Roll a Quick Contest of Interrogation vs. the prisoner’s Will for each question. This requires 5 minutes per question. If you win, you get a truthful answer. If you tie or lose, the victim remains silent or lies. If you lose by more than five points, he tells you a good, believable lie!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Melee Weapon (varies)    | DX/Varies       | Special | This is not one skill, but an entire collection of skills – one per class of closely related melee weapons. Melee Weapon skills are based on DX, and default to DX-4 if Easy, DX-5 if Average, or DX-6 if Hard.<br><br><h5>Fencing Weapons</h5><br>Fencing weapons are light, one-handed weapons, usually hilted blades, optimized for parrying. Skills: Rapier (A) and Smallsword (A). <br><br><h5>Flails</h5><br>A flail is any flexible, unbalanced weapon with its mass concentrated in the head. Because flails tend to wrap around the target’s shield or weapon, attempts to block them are at -2 and attempts to parry them are at -4. Skills: Flail (H; includes morningstars and nunchaku). <br><br><h5>Impact Weapons</h5><br>An impact weapon is any rigid, unbalanced weapon with most of its mass concentrated in the head, such as axes and maces. Such a weapon cannot parry if you have already attacked with it on your turn. Skills: Axe/Mace (A). <br><br><h5>Pole Weapons</h5><br>Pole weapons are long (usually wooden) shafts, often adorned with striking heads. All require two hands. Skills: Polearm (A), Spear (A), Staff (A; also gives +2 to Parry). <br><h5>Swords</h5>A sword is a rigid, hilted blade with a thrusting point, cutting edge, or both. All swords are balanced, and can attack and parry without becoming unready.

Make a skill roll when you first try to mount a riding animal, and again each time something happens to frighten or challenge the creature (e.g., a jump).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Scrounging               | IQ/E            | IQ-4    | This is the ability to find, salvage, or improvise useful items that others can’t locate. Each attempt takes an hour. You do not necessarily steal your booty; you just locate it – somehow – and then acquire it by any means necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Search                   | IQ/A            | IQ-5    | This is the ability to search people, baggage, and vehicles for items that aren’t in plain sight. The GM rolls once – in secret – per item of interest. For deliberately concealed items, this is a Quick Contest of your Search skill vs. the Holdout or Smuggling skill used to hide the item. If you fail, the GM simply says, “You found nothing.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

If someone is specifically on the alert for intruders, the GM will roll a Quick Contest between your Stealth and the sentinel’s Perception.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
