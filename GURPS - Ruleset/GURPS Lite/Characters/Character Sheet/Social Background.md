### Technology Level (TL)
“Technology level” (or “tech level”) is a number that rates technological development. The more advanced the society, the higher its TL. The GM will tell you the TL of his world. Characters also have a TL, equal to that of the technology with which they are most familiar. Unless you are especially primitive or advanced, your personal TL will be the same as the world. In some game worlds, your personal TL may differ from the campaign average. A world might be TL8 on average, but the citizens of one advanced nation might be TL9 while those from an underdeveloped region might be TL7.

| TL Level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Points                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Low TL   | Your personal TL is below that of the campaign world. You start with no knowledge (or default skill) relating to equipment above your personal TL. You can learn DX-based technological skills in play, if you can find a teacher, but fundamental differences in thinking prevent you from learning IQ-based technological skills.     | -5 points/TL below campaign TL |
| High TL  | Your personal TL is above that of the campaign world. You may enter play with skills relating to equipment up to your personal TL. This is most useful if you also have access to high-TL equipment, but the knowledge of a high-tech doctor or scientist can be very useful in a low-tech setting, even without specialized equipment! | 5 points/TL above campaign TL  |

### Language
GURPS assumes that most characters can read and write their “native” language. This ability costs no points, but you should note your native language on your character sheet; e.g., “English (Native) \[0].”
##### Comprehension Levels
The point cost to learn an additional language depends on your “comprehension level”: a measure of how well you function in that language overall. There are four comprehension levels (See the table below):

| Language Proficiency | Description                                                                                                 | Points                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| None                 | You don’t know the language at all.                                                                         | 0 points                                  |
| Broken               | You know just enough to get by in daily life, but you’re at -3 when using skills that depend on language.   | 1 point for spoken, 1 point for written   |
| Accented             | You can communicate clearly. You’re only at -1 when using skills that depend on language.                   | 2 points for spoken, 2 points for written |
| Native               | You can use the language as well as an educated native. You start with one language at this level for free. | 3 points for spoken, 3 points for written |

### Literacy
Your written comprehension level determines your degree of literacy in that language (see the table below). You get Native level written comprehension in your native language for free. 

| Literacy Level | Description                                                                                                                                                            | Disadvantage                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Illiteracy     | A written comprehension level of None means that you cannot read the language at all.                                                                                  | -3 points                                  |
| Semi-literacy  | A written comprehension level of Broken means you must read slowly. Roll vs. IQ just to get the basic meaning!                                                         | -2 points                                  |
| Literacy       | A written comprehension of Accented or Native means you can read and write at full speed. You get Native level written comprehension in your native language for free. | -1 point for Accented, 0 points for Native |
