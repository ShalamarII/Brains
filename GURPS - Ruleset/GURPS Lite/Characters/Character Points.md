### General Overview
Character points are the “currency” of character creation. Anything that improves your abilities costs character points: you must spend points equal to the listed price of an ability to add that ability to your character sheet and use it in play. Anything that reduces your capabilities has a negative cost – that is, it gives you back some points. For instance, if you start with 125 points, buy 75 points of advantages, and take -15 points of disadvantages, you have 125 - 75 + 15 = 65 points remaining.

### Starting Points
The GM decides how many character points the player characters (PCs) – the heroes – start with. This depends on how capable he wants them to be. Some example power levels, with suggested starting points: Feeble (under 25 points): Small children, mindless thralls, zombies, etc. Average (25-50 points): Ordinary folks, such as accountants and cab drivers. Competent (50-75 points): Athletes, cops, wealthy gentry . . . anyone who would have a clear edge over “average” people on an adventure. Exceptional (75-100 points): Star athletes, seasoned cops, etc. Heroic (100-200 points): People at the realistic pinnacle of physical, mental, or social achievement; e.g., Navy SEALs, world-class scientists, and millionaires. Larger Than-Life (200-300 points): Leading roles in kung fu movies, fantasy novels, etc. Legendary (300-500 points): Protagonists of epic poems and folklore.

### Disadvantage Limit
A disadvantage is anything with a negative cost, including low attributes, reduced social status, and all the specific disabilities listed under Disadvantages (p. 10). In theory, you could keep adding disadvantages until you had enough points to buy whatever advantages and skills you wanted. In practice, most GMs will want to set a limit on the disadvantage points a PC may have. A good rule of thumb is to hold disadvantages to 50% of starting points – for instance, -75 points in a 150-point game.
