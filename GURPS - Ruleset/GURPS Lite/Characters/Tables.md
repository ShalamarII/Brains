### GURPS Attribute Score Table
| Attribute Score | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1               | ***Weak beyond compare.*** 1 is the minimum score for a human.                                                                                            |
| 6 or less       | ***Crippling.*** An attribute this bad severely constrains your lifestyle.                                                                                |
| 7               | ***Poor.*** Your limitations are immediately obvious to anyone who meets you.                                                                             |
| 8 or 9          | ***Below average.*** Such scores are limiting, but within the human norm.                                                                                 |
| 10              | ***Average.*** Most humans get by just fine with a score of 10!                                                                                           |
| 11 or 12        | ***Above average.*** These scores are superior, but within the human norm.                                                                                |
| 13 or 14        | ***Exceptional.*** Such an attribute is immediately apparent – as bulging muscles, feline grace, witty dialog, or glowing health – to those who meet you. |
| 15 or more      | ***Amazing.*** An attribute this high draws constant comment and probably guides your career choices.                                                     |
| 20+             | ***Godlike.*** Scores above 20 are possible but typically reserved for godlike beings – ask the GM before buying such a value.                            |

| Acute Senses        | You have superior senses. Each Acute Sense is a separate advantage that gives +1 per level to all Sense rolls (p. 24) you make – or the GM makes for you – using that one sense. The available types are: • Acute Hearing • Acute Taste and Smell • Acute Touch • Acute Vision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 2 points/level                  | Each type is purchased separately.                  |
| Ambidexterity       | You can fight or otherwise act equally well with either hand, and never suffer the -4 DX penalty for using the “off” hand (see p. 5). Should some accident befall one of your arms or hands, assume it is the left one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 5 points                        | Handy for dual-wielding or precision tasks.         |
| Animal Empathy      | IYou are unusually talented at reading the motivations of animals. When you meet an animal, the GM rolls against your IQ and tells you what you “feel.” This reveals the beast’s emotional state – friendly, frightened, hostile, hungry, etc. – and whether it is under supernatural control. You may also use your Influence skills (see p. 15) on animals just as you would on sapient beings, which usually ensures a positive reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 5 points                        | Can also detect supernatural control.               |
| Catfall             | You subtract five yards from a fall automatically (treat this as an automatic Acrobatics success – don’t check again for it). In addition, a successful DX roll halves damage from any fall (see p. 32). To enjoy these benefits, your limbs must be unbound and your body free to twist as you fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 10 points                       | Requires freedom of movement to activate.           |
| Combat Reflexes     | You have extraordinary reactions, and are rarely surprised for more than a moment. You get +1 to all active defense rolls (see Defending, p. 28) and +2 to Fright Checks (see Fright Checks, p. 24). You never “freeze” in a surprise situation, and get +6 on all IQ rolls to wake up, or to recover from surprise or mental “stun.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 15 points                       | Great for combat-heavy characters.                  |
| Danger Sense        | You can’t depend on it, but sometimes you get this prickly feeling right at the back of your neck, and you know something’s wrong . . .The GM rolls once against your Perception, secretly, in any situation involving an ambush, impending disaster, or similar hazard. On a success, you get enough of a warning that you can take action. A roll of 3 or 4 means you get a little detail as to the nature of the danger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 15 points                       | GM rolls Perception secretly.                       |
| Daredevil           | Fortune seems to smile on you when you take risks! Any time you take an unnecessary risk (in the GM’s opinion), you get a +1 to all skill rolls. Furthermore, you may reroll any critical failure that occurs during such high-risk behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 15 points                       | Encourages bold gameplay.                           |
| Empathy             | You have a “feeling” for people. When you first meet someone – or are reunited after an absence – you may ask the GM to roll against your IQ. He will tell you what you “feel” about that person. On a failed IQ roll, he will lie! This talent is excellent for spotting imposters, possession, etc., and for determining the true loyalties of NPCs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 15 points                       | Excellent for social and investigative characters.  |
| Enhanced Defenses   | You are unusually adept at evading attacks! This may be due to careful observation of your foe, focusing chi, or anything else that fits your background. There are three versions: <br><h5>Enhanced Block</h5> <br>You have +1 to your Block score with Shield skill. 5 points. <br><h5>Enhanced Dodge</h5><br>You have +1 to your Dodge score. 15 points. <h5>Enhanced Parry</h5><br>You have +1 to your Parry score. You may take this advantage for bare hands (5 points), for any one Melee Weapon skill (5 points), or for all parries (10 points). 5 or 10 points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 5-15 points (varies)            | Choose based on character build.                    |
| Fearlessness        | You are difficult to frighten or intimidate! Add your level of Fearlessness to your Will whenever you make a Fright Check or must resist the Intimidation skill (p. 15) or a supernatural power that induces fear. You also subtract your Fearlessness level from all Intimidation rolls made against you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 2 points/level                  | Helps resist supernatural or psychological fear.    |
| Flexibility         | Your body is unusually flexible. This advantage comes in two levels: <br><h5>Flexibility</h5><br>You get +3 on Climbing rolls; on Escape rolls to get free of ropes, handcuffs, and similar restraints. You may ignore up to -3 in penalties for working in close quarters (including many Explosives and Mechanic rolls). ***5 points.***<br><br><h5>Double-Jointed</h5><br>As above, but more so. You cannot stretch or squeeze yourself abnormally, but any part of your body may bend any way. You get +5 on Climbing, Escape rolls, and on attempts to break free. You may ignore up to -5 in penalties for close quarters. ***15 points.***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 5 points or 15 points           | Higher levels grant more flexibility benefits.      |
| Hard to Kill        | You are incredibly difficult to kill. Each level of Hard to Kill gives +1 to HT rolls made for survival at -HP or below, and on any HT roll where failure means instant death (due to heart failure, poison, etc.). If this bonus makes the difference between success and failure, you collapse, apparently dead (or disabled), but come to in the usual amount of time – see Recovering from Unconsciousness (p. 30).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2 points/level                  | Works well for durable or resilient characters.     |
| High Pain Threshold | You are as susceptible to injury as anyone else, but you don’t feel it as much. You never suffer a shock penalty when you are injured. In addition, you get +3 on all HT rolls to avoid knockdown and stunning – and if you are tortured physically, you get +3 to resist. The GM may let you roll at Will+3 to ignore pain in other situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 10 points                       | Ideal for combat or torture-resistant roles.        |
| Jumper              | You can travel through time or to parallel worlds (sometimes known as “timelines”) merely by willing the “jump.” Decide whether you are a time-jumper or a worldjumper. To do both, you must buy Jumper (Time) and Jumper (World) separately, at full cost. To initiate a jump, you must visualize your destination, concentrate for 10 seconds, and make an IQ roll. You may hurry the jump, but your roll will be at -1 per second of concentration omitted. Regardless of IQ, a roll of 14 or more always fails. On a success, you appear at your target destination. On a failure, you go nowhere. On a critical failure, you arrive at the wrong destination, which can be any time or world the GM wishes! You appear at your destination at exactly the same place you left your previous time or world – or as close as possible. If there is no corresponding “safe” location within 100 yards of your destination, the jump will fail and you will know why it failed. This ability always costs at least 1 Fatigue Point (see p. 31) to use, whether it succeeds or fails. Particularly “distant” times or worlds might cost more, perhaps up to 10 FP, at the GM’s discretion. | 100 points                      | Requires visualization and fatigue cost.            |
| Language Talent     | You have a knack for languages. When you learn a language at a comprehension level above None, you automatically function at the next higher level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 10 points                       | Perfect for multilingual characters.                |
| Luck                | You were born lucky! There are three progressively more “cinematic” levels of Luck: <h5>Luck</h5><br>Once per hour of play, you may reroll a single bad die roll twice and take the best of the three rolls! You must declare that you are using your Luck immediately after you roll the dice. ***15 points.***<br><h5>Extraordinary Luck</h5><br>As above, but usable every 30 minutes. ***30 points.**** <br><h5>Ridiculous Luck</h5> <br>As above, but usable every 10 minutes! 60 points. <br><br>Your Luck only applies to your own success, damage, or reaction rolls, or on outside events that affect you or your whole party, or when you are being attacked (in which case you may make the attacker roll three times and take the worst roll!).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 15-60 points (varies)           | Frequency of use increases with point investment.   |
| Night Vision        | Your eyes adapt rapidly to darkness. Each level of this ability (maximum nine levels) allows you to ignore -1 in combat or vision penalties due to darkness, provided there is at least some light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 1 point/level                   | Requires minimal ambient light to work.             |
| Perfect Balance     | You can always keep your footing, no matter how narrow the walking surface (tightrope, ledge, tree limb, etc.), under normal conditions without having to make a die roll. If the surface is wet, slippery, or unstable, you get +6 on all rolls to keep your feet. In combat, you get +4 to DX and DX-based skill rolls to keep your feet or avoid being knocked down. Finally, you get +1 to Acrobatics and Climbing skill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 15 points                       | Combines well with acrobatics skills.               |
| Resistant           | You are naturally resistant (or even immune) to diseases or poisons. This gives you a bonus on all HT rolls to resist incapacitation or injury from such things. <br><h5>Resistant to Disease</h5><br>You may take a +3 bonus for 3 points or a +8 bonus for 5. <br><h5>Resistant to Poison</h5><br>You have a +3 bonus, costing 5 points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 3-5 points (varies)             | Specify whether resistance is to disease or poison. |
| Talent              | You have a natural aptitude for a set of closely related skills. “Talents” come in levels, and give a bonus of +1 per level with all affected skills, even for default use. This effectively raises your attribute scores for the purpose of those skills only; thus, this is an inexpensive way to be adept at small class of skills. You may never have more than four levels of a particular Talent. However, overlapping Talents can give skill bonuses (only) in excess of +4. The cost of a Talent depends on the size of the group of skills affected. Some examples: <br><br><h5>Artificer</h5><br>Covers Armoury, Electronics Repair, Engineer, Mechanic, and others. ***10 points/level.*** <br><br><h5>Outdoorsman</h5><br>Covers Camouflage, Naturalist, Navigation, Survival, and Tracking. ***10 points/level.*** <br><h5>Smooth Operator</h5><br>Covers all Influence skills, as well as Acting, Carousing, Leadership, and Public Speaking. ***15 points/level.*** <br><br>There are many other possibilities! GMs are encouraged to create their own Talents as needed.                                                                                                   | Variable (Can be created by DM) | Cost depends on the size of the skill group.        |

| Bad Sight       | You have poor vision, giving -6 to Vision rolls and -2 to hit in combat. This disadvantage costs -10 points at TLs where it is correctable (with glasses or contact lenses), -25 points when it is not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | -10 or -25 points       |
| Bad Temper      | You are not in full control of your emotions. Make a self-control roll in any stressful situation. If you fail, you lose your temper and must insult, attack, or otherwise act against the cause of the stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | -10 points              |
| Bloodlust       | You want to see your foes dead. In battle, you must go for killing blows, and put in an extra shot to make sure of a downed foe. You must make a self-control roll whenever you need to accept a surrender, evade a sentry, take a prisoner, etc. If you fail, you attempt to kill your foe instead – even if that means breaking the law, compromising stealth, wasting ammo, or violating orders. Out of combat, you never forget that a foe is a foe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | -10 points              |
| Code of Honor   | You take pride in a set of principles that you follow at all times. The specifics can vary, but they always involve “honorable” behavior. You will do nearly anything – perhaps even risk death – to avoid the label “dishonorable” (whatever that means to you). The point value of a particular Code of Honor depends on how much trouble it is liable to get you into and how arbitrary and irrational its requirements are. An informal Code that applies only among your peers is worth -5 points. A formal Code that applies only among peers, or an informal one that applies all the time, is worth ***-10 points.*** A formal Code that applies all the time, or that requires suicide if broken, is worth -15 points. The GM has the final say! A couple of examples: <br><h5>Code of Honor (Pirate’s)</h5><br>Always avenge an insult, regardless of the danger; your buddy’s foe is your own; never attack a fellow crewman or buddy except in a fair, open duel. Anything else goes. This is also suitable for brigands, bikers, etc. ***-5 points.*** <br><br><h5>Code of Honor (Gentleman’s)</h5><br>Never break your word. Never ignore an insult to yourself, a lady, or your flag; insults may only be wiped out by an apology or a duel (not necessarily to the death!). Never take advantage of an opponent in any way; weapons and circumstances must be equal (except in open war). This only applies between gentlemen. A discourtesy from anyone of Status 0 or less calls for a whipping, not a duel! ***-10 points. | -5 to -15 points        |
| Curious         | You are naturally very inquisitive. This is not the curiosity that affects all PCs (“What’s in that cave? Where did the flying saucer come from?”), but the real thing (“What happens if I push this button?”). Make a self-control roll when presented with an interesting item or situation. If you fail, you examine it even if you know it could be dangerous. Good role-players won’t try to make this roll very often . . .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | -5 points               |
| Delusions       | You believe something that simply is not true. This may cause others to consider you insane. And they may be right! If you suffer from a Delusion, you must roleplay your belief at all times. The point value of the Delusion depends on its nature. <br><br>A Minor Delusion affects your behavior, and anyone around you will soon notice it (and react at -1), but it does not keep you from functioning more-or-less normally. ***-5 points.*** <br><br>A Major Delusion strongly affects your behavior, but does not keep you from living a fairly normal life. Others will react to you at -2. ***-10 points.*** <br><br>A Severe Delusion affects your behavior so much that it may keep you from functioning in the everyday world. Others react to you at -3, but they are more likely to fear or pity you than to attack. ***-15 points.***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | -5 to -15 points        |
| Gluttony        | You are overly fond of good food and drink. Given the chance, you must always burden yourself with extra provisions. You should never willingly miss a meal. Make a self-control roll when presented with a tempting morsel or good wine that, for some reason, you should resist. If you fail, you partake – regardless of the consequences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | -5 points               |
| Greed           | You lust for wealth. Make a self-control roll any time riches are offered – as payment for fair work, gains from adventure, spoils of crime, or just bait. If you fail, you do whatever it takes to get the payoff. Small sums do not tempt you much if you are rich, but if you are poor, you get -5 or more on your self-control roll if a rich prize is in the offing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | -15 points              |
| Hard of Hearing | You are not deaf, but you have some hearing loss. You are at -4 on any Hearing roll and on any skill roll where it is important that you understand someone (if you are the one talking, this disadvantage doesn’t affect you).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | -10 points              |
| Honesty         | You must obey the law, and do your best to get others to do so as well. In an area with little or no law, you do not “go wild” – you act as though the laws of your own home were in force. You also assume that others are honest unless you know otherwise. This is a disadvantage, because it often limits your options! Make a self-control roll when faced with the “need” to break unreasonable laws; if you fail, you must obey the law, whatever the consequences. If you manage to resist your urges and break the law, make a second self-control roll afterward. If you fail, you must turn yourself in to the authorities!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | -10 points              |
| Impulsiveness   | You hate talk and debate. You prefer action! When you are alone, you act first and think later. In a group, when your friends want to stop and discuss something, you should put in your two cents’ worth quickly – if at all – and then do something. Roleplay it! Make a self-control roll whenever it would be wise to wait and ponder. If you fail, you must act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | -10 points              |
| Intolerance     | You dislike and distrust some (or all) people who are different from you. You may be prejudiced on the basis of class, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sex, or species. Victims of your Intolerance will react to you at -1 to -5 (GM’s decision). Point value depends on the scope of your Intolerance. If you are thoroughly intolerant, you react at -3 toward anyone not of your own class, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or species (pick one). Total Intolerance of this kind is worth -10 points. Intolerance directed at only one specific class, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sex, or species is worth from -5 points for a commonly encountered victim to -1 point (a nasty quirk) for a rare victim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Variable                |
| Jealousy        | You react poorly toward those who seem smarter, more attractive, or better off than you! You resist any plan proposed by a “rival,” and hate it if someone else is in the limelight. If an NPC is jealous, the GM will apply a -2 to -4 reaction penalty toward the victim(s) of his jealousy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | -10 points              |
| Lecherousness   | You have an unusually strong desire for romance. Make a self-control roll whenever in more than the briefest contact with an appealing member of the sex you find attractive – at -5 if this person is Handsome/Beautiful, or at -10 if Very Handsome/Very Beautiful. If you fail, you must make a “pass,” using whatever wiles and skills you can bring to bear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | -15 points              |
| Obsession       | Your entire life revolves around a single goal, an overpowering fixation that motivates all of your actions. Make a self-control roll whenever it would be wise to deviate from your goal. If you fail, you continue to pursue your Obsession, regardless of the consequences. Point cost depends on the time needed to realize your goal. A short-term goal (e.g., assassinating someone) is worth -5 points, while a long-term goal (e.g., becoming President) is worth -10 points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | -5 or -10 points        |
| Overconfidence  | You believe that you are far more powerful, intelligent, or competent than you really are. You may be proud and boastful or just quietly determined, but you must roleplay this trait. You must make a self-control roll any time the GM feels you show an unreasonable degree of caution. If you fail, you must go ahead as though you were able to handle the situation! Caution is not an option. You receive +2 on all reaction rolls from young or naive individuals (who believe you are as good as you say you are), but -2 on reactions from experienced NPCs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | -5 points               |
| Pacifism        | You are opposed to violence. This can take two forms. <br><h5>Reluctant Killer</h5><br>You get -4 to hit a person (not a monster, machine, etc.) with a deadly attack, or -2 if you can’t see his face. If you kill someone, roll 3d – you’re morose and useless for that many days. ***-5 points***. <br><br><h5>Cannot Harm Innocents</h5><br>You may fight – you may even start fights – but you may only use deadly force on a foe that is attempting to do you serious harm. ***-10 points.***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | -5 points to -10 points |
| Phobias         | A “phobia” is a fear of a specific item, creature, or circumstance. The more common an object or situation, the greater the point value of a fear of it. If you have a phobia, you may temporarily master it by making a successful self-control roll . . . but the fear persists. Even if you master a phobia, you will be at -2 to all IQ, DX, and skill rolls while the cause of your fear is present, and you must roll again every 10 minutes to see if the fear overcomes you. If you fail the self-control roll, you will cringe, flee, panic, or otherwise react in a manner that precludes sensible action. Even the mere threat of the feared object requires a self-control roll at +4. If your enemies actually inflict the feared object on you, you must make an unmodified self-control roll. <br><br>Some common phobias: <br>Blood (Hemophobia): ***-10 points.*** <br>Darkness (Scotophobia): ***-15 points.*** <br>Heights (Acrophobia): ***-10 points.***<br>Number 13 (Triskaidekaphobia): Roll at -5 if Friday the 13th is involved! ***-5 points.*** <br>Spiders (Arachnophobia): ***-5 points.***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Variable                |
| Sense of Duty   | You feel a strong sense of commitment toward a particular class of people. You will never betray them, abandon them when they’re in trouble, or let them suffer or go hungry if you can help. The GM will assign a point value to your Sense of Duty based on the size of the group you feel compelled to aid: <br><br>Individual (the President, your wingman, etc.): ***-2 points.*** <br>Small Group (e.g., your close friends, adventuring companions, or squad): ***-5 points.*** <br>Large Group (e.g., a nation or religion, or everyone you know personally): ***-10 points.*** <br>Entire Race (all humanity, all Elves, etc.): ***-15 points.*** <br>Every Living Being: ***-20 points.***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | -2 to -20 points        |
| Truthfulness    | You hate to tell a lie – or you are just very bad at it. Make a self-control roll whenever you must keep silent about an uncomfortable truth (lying by omission). Roll at -5 if you actually have to tell a falsehood! If you fail, you blurt out the truth, or stumble so much that your lie is obvious. You have a permanent -5 to Fast-Talk skill, and your Acting skill is at -5 when your purpose is to deceive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | -5 points               |
| Unluckiness     | You have rotten luck. Things go wrong for you – and usually at the worst possible time. Once per play session, the GM will arbitrarily and maliciously make something go wrong for you. You miss a vital die roll, or the enemy (against all odds) shows up at the worst possible time. If the plot of the adventure calls for something bad to happen to someone, it’s you. The GM may not kill you outright with “bad luck,” but anything less than that is fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | -10 points              |
| Vow             | You have sworn an oath to do (or not to do) something. Whatever the oath, you take it seriously; if you didn’t, it would not be a disadvantage. This trait is especially appropriate for knights, holy men, and fanatics. The point value of a Vow should be directly related to the inconvenience it causes you. The GM is the final judge. Some examples:<br> <br><h5>Minor Vow</h5><br>Silence during daylight hours; vegetarianism; chastity (yes, for game purposes, this is minor). -5 points. <br><br><h5>Major Vow</h5><br>Use no edged weapons; keep silence at all times; never sleep indoors; own no more than your horse can carry. -10 points. <br><br><h5>Great Vow</h5><br>Never refuse any request for aid; always fight with the wrong hand; hunt a given foe until you destroy him; challenge every knight you meet to combat. -15 points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | -5 to -15 points        |

| Influence Skills         | Various         | Various | There are several ways to influence others; each is a separate influence skill. A successful roll will result in a good reaction from an NPC. Failure results in a bad reaction (except for Diplomacy, which is relatively safe). To actually coerce or manipulate an NPC, you must win a Quick Contest of your skill versus his Will. Methods of influencing others include: <br><br><h5>Diplomacy (IQ/H)</h5><br>Negotiation and compromise. Defaults to IQ-6. <br><br><h5>Fast-Talk (IQ/A)</h5><br>Lying and deceit. Defaults to IQ-5. <br><br><h5>Intimidation (IQ/A)</h5><br>Threats and violence. Defaults to IQ-5. <br><h5>Savoir-Faire (IQ/E)</h5><br>Manners and etiquette. Mainly useful in “high society” situations. Defaults to IQ-4. <br><h5>Sex Appeal (HT/A)</h5><br>Vamping and seduction, usually of the opposite sex. Defaults to HT-3. <br><h5>Streetwise (IQ/A)</h5><br>Contacts and (usually) subtle intimidation. Only useful in “street” and criminal situations.

| Interrogation            | IQ/A            | IQ-5    | This is the ability to question a prisoner. Roll a Quick Contest of Interrogation vs. the prisoner’s Will for each question. This requires 5 minutes per question. If you win, you get a truthful answer. If you tie or lose, the victim remains silent or lies. If you lose by more than five points, he tells you a good, believable lie!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Melee Weapon (varies)    | DX/Varies       | Special | This is not one skill, but an entire collection of skills – one per class of closely related melee weapons. Melee Weapon skills are based on DX, and default to DX-4 if Easy, DX-5 if Average, or DX-6 if Hard.<br><br><h5>Fencing Weapons</h5><br>Fencing weapons are light, one-handed weapons, usually hilted blades, optimized for parrying. Skills: Rapier (A) and Smallsword (A). <br><br><h5>Flails</h5><br>A flail is any flexible, unbalanced weapon with its mass concentrated in the head. Because flails tend to wrap around the target’s shield or weapon, attempts to block them are at -2 and attempts to parry them are at -4. Skills: Flail (H; includes morningstars and nunchaku). <br><br><h5>Impact Weapons</h5><br>An impact weapon is any rigid, unbalanced weapon with most of its mass concentrated in the head, such as axes and maces. Such a weapon cannot parry if you have already attacked with it on your turn. Skills: Axe/Mace (A). <br><br><h5>Pole Weapons</h5><br>Pole weapons are long (usually wooden) shafts, often adorned with striking heads. All require two hands. Skills: Polearm (A), Spear (A), Staff (A; also gives +2 to Parry). <br><h5>Swords</h5>A sword is a rigid, hilted blade with a thrusting point, cutting edge, or both. All swords are balanced, and can attack and parry without becoming unready.

Make a skill roll when you first try to mount a riding animal, and again each time something happens to frighten or challenge the creature (e.g., a jump).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Scrounging               | IQ/E            | IQ-4    | This is the ability to find, salvage, or improvise useful items that others can’t locate. Each attempt takes an hour. You do not necessarily steal your booty; you just locate it – somehow – and then acquire it by any means necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Search                   | IQ/A            | IQ-5    | This is the ability to search people, baggage, and vehicles for items that aren’t in plain sight. The GM rolls once – in secret – per item of interest. For deliberately concealed items, this is a Quick Contest of your Search skill vs. the Holdout or Smuggling skill used to hide the item. If you fail, the GM simply says, “You found nothing.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

If someone is specifically on the alert for intruders, the GM will roll a Quick Contest between your Stealth and the sentinel’s Perception.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Low TL   | Your personal TL is below that of the campaign world. You start with no knowledge (or default skill) relating to equipment above your personal TL. You can learn DX-based technological skills in play, if you can find a teacher, but fundamental differences in thinking prevent you from learning IQ-based technological skills.     | -5 points/TL below campaign TL |
| High TL  | Your personal TL is above that of the campaign world. You may enter play with skills relating to equipment up to your personal TL. This is most useful if you also have access to high-TL equipment, but the knowledge of a high-tech doctor or scientist can be very useful in a low-tech setting, even without specialized equipment! | 5 points/TL above campaign TL  |
