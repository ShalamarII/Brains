### General Overview
Adventurers often carry weapons of some sort, whether it’s a knight’s broadsword, a detective’s snub-nosed .38, or a space pirate’s blaster pistol. 

First, decide why you carry a weapon. Is it for self-defense, intimidation (“Stop or I’ll shoot!”), battle, or hunting? Also review your skills and Strength. High-tech weapons (such as guns) work equally well for anyone who knows how to use them. Low-tech weapons – clubs, swords, etc. – do much more damage if wielded by a strong person. Finally, look at the weapon’s statistics. A weapon’s damage rating is the basic measure of its effectiveness, but there are also factors such as range, rate of fire, and accuracy to consider

### Weapons Statistics
Weapon tables provide the items of information explained below. A given column will only appear on a table if it is germane to the weapons on that table. In all cases, “–” means the statistic does not apply, and “var.” means the value varies. 

### TL (Tech Level)
The tech level at which the weapon first becomes widespread. You may only buy weapons of your campaign’s TL or less, unless you have the High TL trait (p. 7). 

---

### Weapon
The general class of weapon in question; e.g., “shortsword” or “assault rifle.” Each entry represents a wide range of individual types. 

For guns, this entry includes a projectile diameter, or “caliber,” given in millimeters (e.g., 9mm) or fractions of an inch (e.g., .50), as customary for the weapon.

# Damage
For muscle-powered melee and missile weapons, such as swords and bows, damage is ST-based and expressed as a modifier to the wielder’s basic thrusting (thr) or swinging (sw) damage, as given on the Damage Table (p. 6). For example, a spear does “thr+2,” so if you have ST 11, which gives a basic thrusting damage of 1d-1, you inflict 1d+1 damage with a spear. Swung weapons act as a lever, and so do more damage. 

For firearms and some powered melee weapons, damage is given as a fixed number of dice plus adds; e.g., a 9mm auto pistol lists “2d+2,” which means that any user would roll 2d and add 2 to get damage. 

### Armor Divisors

A parenthetical number after damage – e.g., (2) – is an armor divisor. Divide the target’s DR from armor or other sources by this number before subtracting it from your damage (or adding it to the target’s HT roll to resist an affliction). For instance, an attack with a divisor of (2) would halve DR. 

### Damage Type

An abbreviation indicating the type of injury or effect the attack causes. 

| Abbreviation | Damage Type    | Notes                                         |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| burn         | burning        |                                               |
| cr           | crushing       |                                               |
| cut          | cutting        | Damage increases by 50% after penetrating DR. |
| imp          | impaling       | Damage doubles after penetrating DR.          |
| pi-          | small piercing | Damage is halved after penetrating DR.        |
| pi           | piercing       |                                               |
| pi+          | large piercing | Damage increases by 50% after penetrating DR. |
A victim loses HP equal to the damage that penetrates his DR. Halve this for small piercing attacks; increase it by 50% for cutting and large piercing attacks; and double it for impaling.

### Damage Roll

Your ST determines how much damage you do in unarmed combat or with a melee weapon. Two types of damage derive from ST: Thrusting damage (abbreviated “thrust” or “thr”) is your basic damage with a punch, kick, or bite, or an attack with a thrusting weapon such as a spear or a rapier. Swinging damage (abbreviated “swing” or “sw”) is your basic damage with a swung weapon, such as an axe, club, or sword – anything that acts as a lever to multiply your ST. 

Consult the following table for your basic damage. This is given in “dice+modifier” format. 

| ST  | Thrust | Swing |
| :---: | :-----: | :-----: |
|  1  |  1d-6  | 1d-5  |
|  2  |  1d-6  | 1d-5  |
|  3  |  1d-5  | 1d-4  |
|  4  |  1d-5  | 1d-4  |
|  5  |  1d-4  | 1d-3  |
|  6  |  1d-4  | 1d-3  |
|  7  |  1d-3  | 1d-2  |
|  8  |  1d-3  | 1d-2  |
|  9  |  1d-2  | 1d-1  |
| 10  |  1d-2  |  1d   |
| 11  |  1d-1  | 1d+1  |
| 12  |  1d-1  | 1d+2  |
| 13  |   1d   | 2d-1  |
| 14  |   1d   |  2d   |
| 15  |  1d+1  | 2d+1  |
| 16  |  1d+1  | 2d+2  |
| 17  |  1d+2  | 3d-1  |
| 18  |  1d+2  |  3d   |
| 19  |  2d-1  | 3d+1  |
| 20  |  2d-1  | 3d+2  |

Damage is sometimes abbreviated “Dmg.” On your character sheet, list thrust followed by swing, separated by a slash; e.g., if you had ST 13, you would list “Damage 1d/2d-1.”

### Acc (Accuracy)
 
 ***Ranged weapons only.*** 
 Add Accuracy to your skill if you took an Aim maneuver on the turn prior to your attack. If the weapon has a built-in scope, the bonus for this appears as a separate modifier after the weapon’s base Acc; e.g., “7+2.”

---
### Range

***Ranged weapons only.***
 If a weapon has only one range number, this is the ***Maximum Range (Max)*** in yards at which it can attack a target. If two numbers appear, separated by a slash, the first is ***Half-Damage Range*** (1/2D) and the second is Max. Damaging attacks on targets at or beyond 1/2D inflict half damage. 
 
 Muscle-powered weapons usually list 1/2D and Max as multiples of the wielder’s ST, not as a fixed range. For example, “¥10/¥15” means 1/2D is 10¥ST and Max is 15¥ST, so someone with ST 10 would have 1/2D 100 and Max 150. For crossbows, use the weapon’s ST in these formulas.

---
### RoF (Rate of Fire)
***Ranged weapons only.***
The maximum number of shots an ordinary shooter can fire in a one-second turn. A weapon can normally fire fewer shots (to a minimum of 1), if you wish, but some special notes apply. 

---
### Shots
***Ranged weapons only.***
The number of shots the weapon can fire before you must reload or recharge it. “T” means the weapon is thrown. To “reload,” pick it up or ready a new weapon! 

The parenthetical number following Shots indicates the number of one-second Ready maneuvers needed to reload all of the weapon’s shots (e.g., by changing magazines) – or, for a thrown weapon, the time needed to ready another weapon. An “i” next to this means you must load shots individually: the time listed is per shot rather than for all shots. 

A crossbow takes the indicated time to ready (4 turns) only if its ST is no greater than yours (see Crossbows and ST, below). Double this if the bow’s ST is 1 or 2 greater. If its ST is 3 or 4 greater, you need a “goat’s foot” device to cock it; this takes 20 turns, and requires you to stand. If its ST is 5 or more above yours, you cannot reload it at all.

---
### Cost
The price of a new weapon, in $. For swords and knives, this includes a sheath or a scabbard. For firearms, this includes the minimal necessary cleaning kit.

---
### Weight
The weight of the weapon, in pounds. For missile weapons with Shots 2+, this is loaded weight. The weight of one full reload appears after a slash.

---
### ST (Strength)
The minimum Strength required to use the weapon properly. If you try to use a weapon that requires more ST than you have, you will be at -1 to weapon skill per point of ST you lack and lose one extra FP at the end of any fight that lasts long enough to fatigue you.

For a melee weapon, your effective ST for damage purposes cannot exceed triple the weapon’s minimum ST. For instance, a large knife has minimum ST 6, so its “maximum ST” is 18; if your ST were 19+, you would compute your damage as if you had ST 18. Natural weapons (e.g., a punch or kick) have neither minimum nor maximum ST.

“†” means the weapon requires two hands. If you have at least 1.5 times the listed ST (round up), you can use a weapon like this in one hand, but it becomes unready after you attack with it. If you have at least twice the listed ST, you can wield it one-handed with no readiness penalty. But if it requires one hand to hold it and another to operate a moving part, like a bow or a pump shotgun, it always requires two hands, regardless of ST.

“‡” means the weapon requires two hands and becomes unready after you attack with it, unless you have at least 1.5 times the listed ST (round up). To use it in one hand without it becoming unready, you need at least three times the listed ST.

“B” indicates a firearm with an attached bipod. When firing from a prone position using the bipod, treat the weapon as if it were braced and reduce its ST requirement to 2/3 of the listed value (round up); e.g., ST 13 becomes ST 9.

Crossbows and ST: Crossbows and prodds have their own ST value. Use this instead of your ST to determine range and damage. You must specify the ST of such a weapon when you buy it. You can always use a bow that is weaker than you. If you use a stronger bow, it does more damage but take longer to cock (see Shots, above).
