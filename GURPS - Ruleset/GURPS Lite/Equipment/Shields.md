### General Overview
Shields are very valuable in low-tech combat, but almost worthless against firearms.

You normally wear a shield strapped to one arm. Your shield hand can’t wield a weapon (preventing you from using twohanded weapons), but it can still carry an item. 

A shield helps all your active defense rolls (Block, Dodge, and Parry) with no particular effort. You can also use a shield actively to block; see Blocking (p. 28). 

The following statistics apply to shields: 
Shield: The kind of shield. 
DB: Defense Bonus. The bonus the shield gives to all of your active defense rolls (see Defending, p. 28) against attacks from the front or shield side, even if you have no skill at all with a shield. 
Cost: The shield’s price, in $. 
Weight: The shield’s weight, in pounds.

| Shield        | DB  | Cost | Weight |
| ------------- | --- | ---- | ------ |
| Small Shield  | 1   | $40  | 8      |
| Medium Shield | 2   | $60  | 15     |
| Large Shield  | 3   | $90  | 25     |
