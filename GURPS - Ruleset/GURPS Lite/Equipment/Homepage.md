### General Overview
Now you need to decide what equipment you have. Usually, the GM sets a reasonable cost and weight for each item of equipment requested by a player. In a modern-day game, he may even refer players to real-life catalogs! Weapons and armor are a special case, however, since their use involves more intricate game mechanics. This section will give you enough information to let you choose your combat gear intelligently. You start with money equal to the campaign starting wealth, modified by your personal wealth level (see p. 8). The GM will supply equipment lists that give cost, weight, and other information about important items, and give you a ruling about anything else you request. Subtract the price of each item you buy from your starting wealth to determine how much money you have left.

### Starting Wealth
“Starting wealth” covers both money and property. Start with the amount of money your wealth level entitles you to for your game world. Buy the possessions you want to start with. Any unspent money is your “bank account.” Realistically, if you have a settled lifestyle, you should put 80% of your starting wealth into home, clothing, etc., which leaves only 20% for “adventuring” gear. If you are a wanderer (pioneer, knight-errant, Free Trader, etc.), or Poor or worse, the GM might allow you to spend all your starting wealth on movable possessions. All prices in GURPS appear in “$”: a convenient abbreviation for any baseline unit of currency suitable to the setting. One $ may be one dollar, one credit, one copper piece, or whatever else is appropriate. Prices assume a typical sale made by an ordinary merchant. Tech level (p. 7) determines starting wealth, as technologically advanced societies tend to be richer. Below is a comparison of TLs and suggested starting wealth.
