### General Overview
Armor is very useful in combat. A single sword blow or bullet can incapacitate or kill you . . . but armor might give you a second chance. Your armor’s Damage Resistance, or DR, subtracts directly from the damage inflicted by your enemies’ weapons. Armor requires no skill to use – you just wear it! Effective armor is heavy, though. Its weight can hinder you (see Encumbrance and Move, p. 22), reducing your Dodge and Karate Parry.

### Armor Table
The armor table that follows includes an article of light, common clothing to wear underneath – or padding, if this is usual for the armor. The statistics already reflect this; you do not have to buy clothing or padding separately, or account for its DR and weight. 

The tables give the following information for each item of armor: 
Armor: The item’s name. 
DR: The amount of Damage Resistance the item gives. Subtract this from any blow that strikes the armored location. For instance, if you’re wearing a DR 6 plate and are hit in the torso for 8 points of damage, only 2 points penetrate and affect you. 
Cost: The item’s price, in $. 
Weight: The item’s weight, in pounds.
