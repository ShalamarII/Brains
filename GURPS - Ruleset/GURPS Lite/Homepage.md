### What is GURPS?
GURPS stands for “Generic Universal Roleplaying System,” the RPG that these rules are condensed from. Why is it called that? Well . . . 
<h5>“Generic.”</h5>
GURPS starts with simple rules, and builds up to as much optional detail as you like. This abridged version presents the “core rules” that most GMs start with. 

<h5>“Universal.”</h5>
The basic rule system is designed to emphasize realism. It can fit any situation – fantasy or historical; past, present, or future. 
<h5>“Roleplaying.”</h5>
This is not just a “hack-and-slash” game. The rules are written to make true roleplaying possible – and to encourage it. In GURPS, you pretend, for a little while, to be someone else. 

<h5>“System.”</h5>
Over 200 different books have been published for GURPS, in eight different languages (so far). It is one of the recognized standards for roleplaying, worldwide.

### About GURPS Lite
This is the boiled-down “essence” of GURPS: all the fundamental rules, but not the options and embellishments that often confuse new players. Once you’re comfortable with these rules, you can pick up the GURPS Basic Set (CREATE A LINK TO THE HOMEPAGE OF THE BASIC SET) and jump right into the action. Experienced Game Masters will, we hope, find this a valuable tool for introducing new players to the game.
