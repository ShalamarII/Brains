### What is a Success Roll?

A “success roll” is a die roll made when you need to “test” one of your skills or abilities. Sometimes you roll; sometimes the GM rolls for you. For instance, you might test, or roll against, your Strength to stop a heavy door from closing.

### What to Roll?

- Whenever a character attempts to perform an action (e.g., use a skill), roll three dice to determine the outcome. This is called a success roll. The task in question succeeds if the total rolled on the dice is less than or equal to the number that governs the action – most often a skill or an attribute. Otherwise, it fails. For example, if you are rolling against Strength, and your ST is 12, a roll of 12 or less succeeds. Thus, the higher the stat you are rolling against, the easier it is to make the roll. Regardless of the score you are rolling against, a roll of 3 or 4 is always a success, while a roll of 17 or 18 is always a failure. In general, the player makes the die rolls for his character’s actions. However, the GM may always choose to roll the dice in secret – see ***When the GM Rolls***, below.

### When to Roll?

To avoid bogging down the game in endless die rolls, the GM should only require a success roll if...
- A PC’s health, wealth, friends, reputation, or equipment are at risk. This includes chases, combat (even if the target is stationary and at point-blank range!), espionage, thievery, and similar “adventuring” activities.
- A PC stands to gain allies, information, new abilities, social standing, or wealth. 

The GM should not require rolls for . . .
- Utterly trivial tasks, such as crossing the street, driving into town, feeding the dog, finding the corner store, or turning on the computer. 
- Daily work at a mundane, non-adventuring job.

### When the GM Rolls?

1. When the character wouldn’t know for sure whether he had succeeded. 
2. When the player shouldn’t know what’s going on.

---
### Modifiers

- Modifiers affect the E.S. Of the roll, NOT the roll of the PC

---
## Base Skill vs. Effective Skill

- Base skill is the actual level in a skill, as recorded on your sheet
- Effective skills is your base skills +/- modifiers
- You may not attempt a success roll if your effective skill is less than 3
##### Degree of Success / Failure

- The difference of your Success/Failure to E.S. is your MoS/MoF

###  Critical Success and Failure
A critical success is an especially good result.
A roll of 3 or 4 is always a critical success. 
A roll of 5 is a critical success if your effective skill is 15+. 
A roll of 6 is a critical success if your effective skill is 16+.

| Roll | Effective Skill Requirement | Result           |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 3    | Any                         | Critical Success |
| 4    | Any                         | Critical Success |
| 5    | 15+                         | Critical Success |
| 6    | 16+                         | Critical Success |
A critical failure is an especially bad result.
- A roll of 18 is always a critical failure. 
- A roll of 17 is a critical failure if your effective skill is 15 or less; otherwise, it is an ordinary failure. 
- Any roll of 10 or more greater than your effective skill is a critical failure: 16 on a skill of 6, 15 on a skill of 5, and so on.

| Roll | Effective Skill Requirement | Result           |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 18   | Any                         | Critical Failure |
| 17   | 15 or less                  | Critical Failure |
| 17   | Greater than 15             | Ordinary Failure |
| x    | x+10                        | Critical Failure |

### Repeated Attempts
Sometimes you only get one chance to do something (defuse a bomb, jump over a crevasse, remove an inflamed appendix, please the King with a song). Other times you can try over and over again until you succeed (pick a lock, catch a fish, analyze a poison). Still other times you will not know whether you succeeded or failed until it’s too late to try again (translate an old treasure map, order in a French restaurant, build a ship). Finally, there are times when you are injured by failure but can afford to fail a few times (climb a wall, impress a savage tribesman). The GM must use common sense to distinguish among these cases, according to the exact situation in which the adventurers find themselves.

## Contests

Sometimes a situation arises in which two characters must compare attributes, skills, or other traits to settle a competition.
#### Quick Contest
 Both of them roll the success check (or auto-fail if they have 3 or less E.S.)
 - If 1 succeeds and 1 fails, the one who wins claims victory.
 - If both succeed, the one with the greatest margin of success wins.
 - If both fail, the one with the least margin of failure wins
#### Regular Contest
Both of them roll the success check (or auto-fail if they have 3 or less E.S.)
- Keep continuing until one succeeds, and the other fails.
