# General Overview
A “damage roll” is a roll made in a fight, to see how much harm you did to your foe. Damage rolls use the “dice+modifier” system (see p. 2). Many things can affect the final injury inflicted by your attack. Armor reduces the damage received by the wearer. Certain attacks do extra damage if they get through armor. All these things are explained in the combat rules – for more information, see [[Combat Rules]].

## Damage (Dmg) 
Your ST determines how much damage you do in unarmed combat or with a melee weapon. Two types of damage derive from ST: Thrusting damage (abbreviated “thrust” or “thr”) is your basic damage with a punch, kick, or bite, or an attack with a thrusting weapon such as a spear or a rapier. Swinging damage (abbreviated “swing” or “sw”) is your basic damage with a swung weapon, such as an axe, club, or sword – anything that acts as a lever to multiply your ST. 

Consult the following table for your basic damage. This is given in “dice+modifier” format. 

| ST  | Thrust | Swing |
| :---: | :-----: | :-----: |
|  1  |  1d-6  | 1d-5  |
|  2  |  1d-6  | 1d-5  |
|  3  |  1d-5  | 1d-4  |
|  4  |  1d-5  | 1d-4  |
|  5  |  1d-4  | 1d-3  |
|  6  |  1d-4  | 1d-3  |
|  7  |  1d-3  | 1d-2  |
|  8  |  1d-3  | 1d-2  |
|  9  |  1d-2  | 1d-1  |
| 10  |  1d-2  |  1d   |
| 11  |  1d-1  | 1d+1  |
| 12  |  1d-1  | 1d+2  |
| 13  |   1d   | 2d-1  |
| 14  |   1d   |  2d   |
| 15  |  1d+1  | 2d+1  |
| 16  |  1d+1  | 2d+2  |
| 17  |  1d+2  | 3d-1  |
| 18  |  1d+2  |  3d   |
| 19  |  2d-1  | 3d+1  |
| 20  |  2d-1  | 3d+2  |

Damage is sometimes abbreviated “Dmg.” On your character sheet, list thrust followed by swing, separated by a slash; e.g., if you had ST 13, you would list “Damage 1d/2d-1.”
