### General Overview
When the PCs meet an NPC whose reaction to them is not predetermined (see below), the GM makes a “reaction roll” on 3d. The higher the roll, the better the reaction. The GM then plays the NPC according to the guidelines on the Reaction Table. The GM should keep this roll secret from the players. They don’t know, for instance, whether that friendly-looking old farmer is giving them straight advice or sending them into a trap. ***A reaction roll is not a success roll.*** 
There are three important differences: 
1. There is no “target number” to roll against. 
2. A high roll is good, not bad. 
3. Reaction modifiers apply directly to the die roll. 

A reaction bonus is any factor that makes NPCs friendlier, while a reaction penalty is something that biases NPCs against the PCs.

Some common reaction modifiers: 
- ***Personal appearance and behavior.*** This is especially true for the PC who does the talking! Above-average appearance gives a bonus, as do some advantages (see p. 8). Below-average appearance and many disadvantages give a penalty. 
- ***Racial or national biases.*** Elves don’t like dwarves, Frenchmen don’t care for Germans, and so on. These are usually penalties, and take the form of an Intolerance disadvantage on the part of the NPC. 
- ***Appropriate behavior by the players!*** Here’s a chance to reward good roleplaying. A good approach should be worth +1 or more! A wholly inappropriate approach that antagonizes the NPCs should give the party -1 or -2 on the reaction roll. Don’t tell the players, “You blew it!” – just roleplay the offended character, and let them figure it out. 
- Random reaction rolls are great when they add a note of unpredictability to the game – this is more fun for the GM, too! However, never substitute random die rolls for reason and logic.

## Reaction Table
Roll 3 dice and apply any reaction modifiers, then choose the reaction based on the result.

| Score Range       | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 or less         | Disastrous. The NPC hates the characters and will act in their worst interest. Nothing is out of the question: assault, betrayal, public ridicule, or ignoring a life-or-death plea are all possible. |
| 1 to 3            | Very Bad. The NPC dislikes the characters and will act against them if it’s convenient to do so: attacking, offering grossly unfair terms in a transaction, and so on. |
| 4 to 6            | Bad. The NPC cares nothing for the characters and will act against them (as above), if he can profit by doing so.                           |
| 7 to 9            | Poor. The NPC is unimpressed. He may make threats, demand a huge bribe before offering aid, or something similar.                            |
| 10 to 12          | Neutral. The NPC ignores the characters as much as possible. He is totally uninterested. Transactions will go smoothly and routinely, as long as protocol is observed. |
| 13 to 15          | Good. The NPC likes the characters and will be helpful within normal, everyday limits. Reasonable requests will be granted.                 |
| 16 to 18          | Very Good. The NPC thinks highly of the characters and will be quite helpful and friendly, freely offering aid and favorable terms in most things. |
| 19 or better      | Excellent. The NPC is extremely impressed by the characters, and will act in their best interests at all times, within the limits of his own ability – perhaps even risking his life, wealth, or reputation. |
