### End of Day Report:
Today was cold. We walked throughout the hills, searching for creatures that the villagers are worried of. Though I am but a glassblower, I believe these creatures can be assuaged, or taken care of relatively easy. When we set up camp, we found bugs, rubbing their hands together, as if conniving. The crew I travel with is... creative to put it lightly. A glassblower, oyster shucker, a fireman and a gravedigger. Truly the heroes of legend. Tonight I am watching the stars, hoping that we do not get lost.
