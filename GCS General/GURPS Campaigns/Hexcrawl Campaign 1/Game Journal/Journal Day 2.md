Finn, our resident glassblower, found evidence of humanoid tracks to our south. What this means for us and our investigation, I don't know- but may it be a boon, and not a bane.

### End of Day Report:
Finn handed me this 'Group Journal', which I believe is meant to keep track of our progress. It'll likely be useful in case anyone ever comes across our bodies, I suppose. I may as well try to perform well for the sake of our village, but I can't say our ragtag group is particularly inspiring. 
Speaking of uninspiring; the weather was horrible today- it would NOT stop raining. I hope tomorrow will feature a lack of rain and swamp.
