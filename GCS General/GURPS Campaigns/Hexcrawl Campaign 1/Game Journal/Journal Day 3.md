We are searching for a humanoid creature that Finn found tracks of. Found a Female Lightfoot Halfling with silky dark brown hair, with painted nails that was looting corpses. We asked her about any strange occurrences. She told us that she is scouting for her Hamlet (21-60 people). She found corpses, and was looting them. We gleaned after her, and were able to make out with a sword and a pouch.
