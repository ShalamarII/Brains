It hurts. I am separated from the woman whom I love, whom I confided in. Life is fickle, where are here one moment, gone the next. But the fantastic imagery we have known never fades. Smiles, glimmers of hope showering grace amongst those unworthy.

What is nature? Is it to flounder about in such utter misfortune that one finds it comfortable? Is it lacking strength and knowing little, but having an intuition that if only you were stronger, if only you were smarter, if only (God Forbid) you were capable of being with some sort of finality. As to be one, not dull, not embarked in some grand journey, but some churlish experience. To be writ into the annals of history, a mad-man; a pre-ponderance, a thought, an idea. Hardly a man, after all. To be some amorphous blob, some troglodyte that could at last claim safety in the dangerous, glory in the mundane. Oh, to be such a thing.
