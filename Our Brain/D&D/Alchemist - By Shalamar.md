[[D&D]]

## Standard Rules for Potions

- There are 3 quality levels of potions (I, II, III).
- Potions have 1dX brew time, which will be in the potions stats.
- You cannot stack the same potion effect, higher Quality overrides lower Quality of the same type.
- Drinking a potion takes an action unless stated otherwise.
- You may only have up to 3 effects active at anytime on a single creature.
- To resist the effects of being splashed with a potion make a constitution save with a DC of 10 + Potion Quality (unless stated otherwise.)
- To resist the effects of ingesting a potion, make constitution save with a DC of 10 + (Potion Quality * 2).

## Class Features
### Inaccuracy 
- You may try to approximate the effects of a potion with other materials, though failure is all so common. When creating a potion without accurate ingredients roll 1d20 plus Mastery Points with disadvantage, with the DC being detailed in the potions description.
- Higher Qualities of Potion add Xd4 of Difficulty where X is the Quality minus one.
- (Creator's note: DC is at least 12 for inaccurate creation.)

| Character Level  | Mastery Points Bonus  |
|---|---|
|1|+0|
|3|+2|
|5|+4|
|7|+6|
|9|+8|
|11|+10|
 
### Potion Compounding
- You can combine up to 3 potions into one singular potion containing all effects. (Decide the order of effects when combining as a variant rule.)   
- The total time to combine is 1 long rest and you can combine half the amount (rounded up) you can create per short rest.   
- The Quality of the potions combined must equal 5

### The Deep Truth
- As a inheritor of a science you have an understanding of alchemy's botanical past and underlying theory.
- When a creature that is willing makes an arcana or medicine check, add your Alchemist level to that roll. This can happen up to 2 times per short rest. 
## Subclasses

- Ingest-able drinks by ANYONE (Bringing out the life energy of it's users) (Support)  
- Spell-giving Alchemist (Grant Caster)Â   
- Augmented Weapons Alchemist (Augmenting all weapons)
- Splashing potions on people (Augmenting the Container as well)
### Misc. Rules

- Spells you give are one time use. They keep their base stats except the requirement of Components. They can be cast regardless of class. After obtaining a spell through a potion, you have 24 hours to use it before the strength of it fades away. (Spell-giving Alchemist Subclass only.)
## Mir Notes
