## How I Feel
	Today I talked to my mom about not going to college and how it's stressing me out. She told me that I need to do next steps ASAP to get into college in the Spring. I'm going to begin working on it. I also am going to begin programming a application that handles what I'm currently listening to, learning, and reading. I want to call it "Crunching Numbers".

## What can I do to reduce stress?
	Begin to work out. Even a little bit should help immensely with stress.
