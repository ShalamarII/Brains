## How I Feel
Morning: I feel excited, I am starting a new schedule at work, and I think the extra money could help me out. I am a bit stressed out by college, because I think I might be too late to enroll now, because of my procrastination. I am also feeling poorly at the fact that I had to borrow money from Veronica. I also spent my money on things I shouldn't have, as denoted in _The Richest Man In Babylon (George Samuel Clason)._ It warns against doing this, and so I shall begin my savings anew. 

Evening: I am still excited, though late (9:00). I've been thinking a lot recently about my future and what I will become. I want to become a man people look up to. Someone that they can point to and definitively say, "He's a good man." My entire life I've feared that I won't be able to. I'm happy to start now.
## What can I do to reduce stress?
	Wake up on time.
	Be punctual.
