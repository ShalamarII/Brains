Three of the most important kinds of sentences in mathematics are universal statements, conditional statements, and existential statements.
### Universal Statements
An universal statement says that a certain property is true for all elements in a set. (Ex: All positive numbers are greater than zero.)

Universal statements contain a variation of the words "for every".

### Conditional Statements
A conditional statement says that if one thing is true then some other thing also must be true. (Ex: If 12 is divisible by 4, 12 must also be divisible by 3.)

Conditional statements contain a variation of the words "if *blank* then *blank*"
### Existential Statements
An existential statement says that there is at least one thing for which a given property is true. (Ex: There is a prime number that is even.)

### Universal Conditional Statements
An universal conditional statement is true for all things if the rules are met. (Ex: For every animal, if it is a dog, then it is a mammal.)

### Universal Existential Statements
A universal existential statement is a statement that is universal because its first part says that a certain property is true for all objects of a given set, and it is existential because the second part asserts the existence of something. (Ex: Every real number has an additive inverse.)

### Existential Universal Statements
An existential universal statement is a statement that is existential because its first part asserts that an object exists and is universal because the second part says the object satisfies a certain property for all things of a certain kind. (Ex: There is a positive integer that is less than or equal to every positive integer.)
