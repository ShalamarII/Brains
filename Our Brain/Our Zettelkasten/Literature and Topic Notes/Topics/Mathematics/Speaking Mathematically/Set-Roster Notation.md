If S is a set, the notation x -> S means that x is an element of S. The notation x -/> S means that x is not an element of S. A set may be specified using the set-roster notation by writing all of its elements between braces. For example, {1, 2, 3} denotes the set whose elements are 1, 2, and 3. A variation of the notation is sometimes used to describe a very large set, as when we write {1, 2, 3, . . ., 100} to refer to the set of all integers from 1 to 100. A similar notation can also describe an infinite set, as when we write {1, 2, 3, . . . } to refer to the set of all positive integers. (The symbol . . . is called an ellipsis and is read “and so forth.”)
