Probably the most important goal of a first course in discrete mathematics is to help students develop the ability to think abstractly. This means learning to use logically valid forms of argument and avoid common logical errors, appreciating what it means to reason from definitions, knowing how to use both direct and indirect arguments to derive new results from those already known to be true, and being able to work with symbolic representations as if they were concrete objects
