Zettelkasten consists of small items of information stored on slips or cards that are linked by subject headings.

A Zettelkasten was already used by many individual researchers and by organizations to manage information. 
[Conrad Gessner] invented his own version in which the individual notes could be rearranged at any time.
His recommendation of gluing slips onto bound sheets was a innovation in moving from commonplace books to index cards.
