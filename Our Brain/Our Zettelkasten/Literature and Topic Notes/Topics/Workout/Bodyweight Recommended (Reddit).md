# Welcome to the Recommended Routine

- **This routine will cover the following goals:**
    
    - Strength
    - Hypertrophy/Muscle Gain (provided your [diet](https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/) is aligned for this goal)
    - Fat Loss (provided your [diet](https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/) is aligned for this goal)
    - Check the [goals page for more details](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/goals) to see if this routine will help you reach your goals.
- **Overall Structure of this Routine:**
    
    - **Warm Up**
        - Dynamic stretches
        - Joint prep
        - Movement practice
    - **Strength Work**
        - 6 exercises, put in pairs (explained below) to target all the major muscle groups in your upper and lower body
        - 3 exercises in a triplet to target improving your core strength
- **You will need access to:**
    
    - A place to do Rows (Low Bar, or Gymnastics Rings, a Sturdy Table, or even [a knotted bedsheet in a door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr8ZA-cvH3s); This is **_non negotiable_** regardless of physical skill level. Rows are absolutely integral to the quality of the routine and cannot be substituted.)
    - A place to do pull ups, if you are at the point in the program where you add pull-ups (monkey bars, Pull-up bar, rings, etc). Additional alternatives in the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_i_have_no_equipment_to_do_pullups_.2F_rows_.2F_dips.21)
    - [Parallel Bars](http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/antranik-holding-support-hold-on-parallel-bars.jpg) (There are progressions that can be done in place of these once you have reached the appropriate level which do not require these, so if you absolutely cannot find the corner of a kitchen counter, two sturdy chairs, or anything like that, do not let this bar you from starting.)

## Weekly Schedule

- 3x a week, with at least one rest day (or [skill day](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/skillday)) in between workout days.
    
- Examples: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (MWF) or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday (TuThSat) or Wednesday, Friday, Sunday (WFSun). Whatever fits your schedule.
    
- Don't purposely split the workout into separate days unless you have to. It's meant to be a full body workout. Here's [why](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6talge/split_routines_tend_to_be_suboptimal_for_beginners/).
    

## How Progressions Work

- It's hard to adjust the difficulty of bodyweight exercises like with weight training by using heavier dumbells or barbells. Therefore, you need to use different variations of an exercise to increase the difficulty. For example, some may find a push-up on its own too difficult or too easy. Therefore, variations of the pushup exist to make it easer (e.g. incline push-ups or knee pushups) or harder (decline, diamond, ring, pseudo planche etc. push-ups). Generally, you will pick a variation that is appropriate to your strength level as too easy or too difficult will make things harder to progress.
    
- When starting the strength portion of the Recommended Routine, you will be greeted with progression exercises listed in order of increasing difficulty. Pick an appropriately difficult progression for your current level of strength, and perform 3 sets of 5 reps of that progression on your first session. In subsequent sessions you should try to add one rep per set until you are performing 3 sets of 8 reps with good form. From here you should move on to the next progression, but again at 3 sets of 5 reps. Note that this means that you only perform _one_ of the exercises from each of the listed progressions in each session. Once you move up in the progression, there's no need to keep the easier exercises in your routine (except for using it as a warm-up if you feel like it).
    
- Some of the exercises are isometrics (or static) holds, such as the support holds or the "tuck front lever" in the rowing progression. Instead of dynamic reps, one set here consists of simply holding the position statically for 10-30 seconds. Move on to the next harder progression once you hit 30 seconds for all 3 sets.
    
- You'll see there are multiple "progression paths" for the exercises. However, don't overthink this - if you're not sure pick the main progression and do it. If for some reason you can't follow the main progression (lack of specific equipment, for example) then pick one of the alternatives and do it.

**Instructions:** There are nine exercises. These exercises are performed in pairs and triplets to save time. Pairing two exercises means doing a set of the first exercise, resting 90 seconds, then doing a set of the second exercise, resting 90 seconds, and repeating until you've done 3 sets of that pair. For the triplet, you do a set of the first exercise, rest 60 seconds, do a set of the second exercise, rest 60 seconds, do a set of the third exercise, rest 60 seconds, and repeating until you've done 3 sets of that triplet. See the FAQs below if you're still confused.

**Rest time:** If 90 seconds is not enough and you are starting to drop drops (e.g. you did 8 reps the first set, but the next set of the same exercise you can only do 5-6 reps), you can rest up to 3 minutes. Quality is more important than reducing time.

**Tempo:** Ideally, all exercises are to be performed in "10X0" (1,0,X,O) tempo. The numbers explain how long each phase should last, and go in the order of: (1 second eccentric) On the way Down / (0 second) Pause at the Bottom / (X - accelerating fast concentric) On the way up / (0 second) Pause at the top. So 10X0 means 1 'mississippi' second duration on the way down, no pause at the bottom, explode up and no pause at the top. When "exploding up", if the actual movement is slow, that's okay, it's the intent that matters.

Overall, if your pull-up max is say 8 reps, then go for one rep short of failure such as 7-7-7 instead of 8-6-5. The key is to not work at failure for the first set or two because it significantly detracts from performance in later sets which reduces your ability to perform good reps and maximize volume to get stronger and bigger muscles. The 90 second pairing is so that there is minimum 3 minutes rest between each set, which is 3 minutes total. This rest time is where there is 99% replenishment of ATP in the muscles, so you are not limited by fatigue in the muscles. Sticking with failure-1 repetitions and 3 total minutes between sets of the same exercise allows you to maximize volume and effort level which is essential for strength and hypertrophy.

![Stretch Photo](fullbodystrech.png)
Programming

Do this program 2-3 times a week! It will take ~30 minutes. If you have time issues, you can switch between upper and lower body.

The stretching protocol is to be done in the following order. Try to go a little deeper each time after the bumping movements.

- Do 10 small gentle bumping movements into the stretch
    
- Hold the stretch for 10 seconds
    
- Do 10 small gentle bumping movements into the stretch
    
- Hold the stretch for 20 seconds
    
- Do 10 small gentle bumping movements into the stretch
    
- Hold the stretch for 30 seconds
    
- Done. Don't forget to breathe!
    

The Stretches

Upper Body ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=159))

- [**Shoulder Backbend**](https://i.imgur.com/VlZ0FVr.png) | The shoulder backbend focuses on shoulder overhead flexibility. This is important for many weightlifting exercises, but also for handstands and hand-balancing. It is also important for shoulder health, especially when older. Stand up with a straight bodyline, tense your butt muscles and move your arms overhead. Move your arms backwards without losing the straight bodyline. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=161))
    
- [**Spine Backbend**](https://i.imgur.com/GqJdRKA.png) | The spine backbend focuses on thoracic spine mobility. If you ever dreamt of doing bridges on the floor, this is your exercise. A good thoracic spinal mobility can be progressed into all kinds of [fancy exercises](https://media3.giphy.com/media/12lXUg3Zm8jhjW/200w.gif). Place your palms (or fingertips) on your shoulderblades and tense your butt. Now lean back without arching your lower back and move the arms. You can bend the knees a little. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=357))
    
- [**Rear Hand Clasp**](https://i.imgur.com/2Tb7ric.png) | Did you ever want to scratch your back but couldn't reach the spot because you lacked behind-the-back flexibility? This is your exercise. It's good for your shoulderblades and to counter long sitting periods. This stretch is very important for upper body posture aswell! Get into a straight bodyline. Take a towel, a band or a t-shirt and grab both ends with your arms. One arm is overhead and one is behind the back. The upper arm pulls the lower arm gently into the stretch. Pull upwards. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=494))
    
- [**Lying Cross**](https://i.imgur.com/IghCB3M.png) | The lying cross is a stretch that is aimed at people with poor posture. Start on all fours and move one arm below the other arm until your shoulder [touches the floor.](https://i.imgur.com/gSSlesx.png) To deepen the stretch, lay down on the floor and extend the non-stretched arm to the front. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=809))
    
- [**Wrist-Biceps Stretch**](https://i.imgur.com/oLzxXRA.png) | This stretch works on your wrist flexibility and stretches your forearms, your biceps and your deltoid muscles. Stand next to a wall and place your palms on it. Fingers pointing backwards. Now straighten your arm and twist your upper body to the opposite direction. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=962))
    

Lower Body ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1248))

- [**One-Leg Pike**](https://i.imgur.com/AkQKIrG.png) | This stretches your hamstrings. Most people that sit on a computer all day have tight hamstrings, because those muscles are very tensed in a chair-sitting position. When you stretch them regularily, you can take load off your lower back. Flexible hamstrings progress into [the pike stretch](http://bravocrossfit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seated-pike-.jpg). Place your foot on a chair and lean forward with a straight back. If you're advanced enough to touch your toes with a straight back (!), then you can progress to the [standing version of the stretch.](https://i.imgur.com/SWZAKMa.png) ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1248))
    
- [**Kneeling Lunge**](https://i.imgur.com/uzdn3Ad.png) | The kneeling lunge works on your hamstrings, your quads and your hip muscles like the iliopsoas. This is the most important stretch to gain flexibility for the [front splits](https://cdn.gmb.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/splits-front.jpg). Place one foot in front of you and extend it slowly with a straight back. Use your hands to balance yourself properly. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1521))
    
- [**Pancake**](https://i.imgur.com/uOIvAJG.png) | The pancake stretches your hamstrings and your leg adductors. With strong leg adductors, you will have it much easier in martial arts and all dance moves. It also [looks really cool](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e3a24d9f74564d81effe58/t/5a7d733324a6949ae9f16915/1518170938439/Pancake.jpg) in the full progression. Sit on the floor with a straight back and extend the legs to both sides. Lean forward. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1798))
    
- [**Butterfly**](https://i.imgur.com/4q11Ia1.png) | A strong butterfly is a prequisite for [the lotus sit.](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9f808e5ce01637404beb8e2949ce5ebe-c) Sit on the floor with a straight back and move your soles together. Grab them with your hands and gently pull forward with a straight back. Try to bring your knees to the floor. If that's not yet possible, feel free to place a pillow under your knees. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1930))
    
- [**Calf Stretch**](https://i.imgur.com/eWF32yZ.png) | Many people neglect their calf muscles, although it is necessary to give your calves some love. Tight calves love to cramp and hurt. It can prevent heel spurs and all kind of degenerative feet diseases to regularily stretch and strengthen your feet muscles. Grab something and bend one knee forward. Extend the back leg and try to push the heel into the ground. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=2043))
