The IoT is changing the job market. Traditional jobs are being replaced with jobs that are designed to embrace this new world and all it offers.

In IT, opportunities may be specific to edge computing, developing new processes, or a specialization in a discipline that has not yet been realized. These jobs reflect skills spanning multiple disciplines that include computer science, computer engineering (a blend of computer science and electrical engineering), and software engineering in the following areas:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Application Development
- IoT Program Developer
- IoT Security Specialist
- Collaboration
- Enterprise Networks
- Data Center and Virtualization

Not all jobs created by the IoT are IT-related. The IoT should be considered an enabling technology which has applications across all industries and aspects of our daily lives. For example, a city planner uses the data collected by IoT-enabled devices to plan out new city services. Sales people use IoT technology to enhance the sales experience with the customer, and stores use IoT technology to maintain proper inventory levels to match customer demand.

The IoT has created an abundance of jobs within its sphere. These jobs exist across various spectrums of the design, development and enabling of the IoT. There are broad categories that summarize the job opportunities that exist in the evolving digitized world:

- **Enablers** – These jobs develop and implement the underlying technology.
- **Engagers** –These jobs design, create, integrate, and deliver IoT services to customers.
- **Enhancers** – These jobs devise their own value-added services, on top of the services provided by Engagers, which are unique to the Internet of Things.
