Physical security not only protects access to the premises, but also protects people and equipment. For example, fire alarms, sprinklers, seismically-braced server racks, and redundant heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and UPS systems are in place to protect people and equipment.
Physical security within the data center can be divided into two areas, outside and inside.

- **Outside perimeter security**- This can include on-premise security officers, fences, gates, continuous video surveillance, and security breach alarms.
- **Inside perimeter security**Â - This can include continuous video surveillance, electronic motion detectors, security traps, and biometric access and exit sensors.

Security traps provide access to the data halls where data center data is stored. A security trap is similar to an air lock. A person must first enter the security trap using their badge ID proximity card. After the person is inside the security trap, facial recognition, fingerprints, or other biometric verifications are used to open the second door. The user must repeat the process to exit the facility.
