Certifications can show an employer that an individual has the appropriate skills for a job. Community college or university degrees can show that a person has gained a broad understanding in a field of study. This broad understanding creates a solid foundation for emerging career opportunities in the IoT. A combination of industry certifications and university degrees provides a student with the best background, experience, and education to pursue a career with greater opportunities and higher salary.

When looking for a degree to pursue at a community college or university that will pertain to the skillsets needed for a career in the IoT, watch for some of the following degrees:
