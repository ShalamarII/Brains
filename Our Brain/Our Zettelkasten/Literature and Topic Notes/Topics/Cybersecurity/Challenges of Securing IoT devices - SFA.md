IoT devices are developed with the necessary network connectivity capabilities but often do not implement strong network security. Network security is a critical factor when deploying IoT devices. Methods must be taken to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and security of the data, the path from the sensor to the collector, and the connectivity to the device.

**Increasing Number of Devices**

The number of interconnected sensors and smart devices is growing exponentially, increasing the opportunity for attacks. Sensors and smart devices tend to be small devices, with varying operating systems, CPU types, and memory. Many of these objects will be inexpensive, single-function devices with rudimentary network connectivity.

**Non-Traditional Location of Devices**

Some connected IoT devices are able to interact with the physical world. They are now located in appliances, in automobiles, on or in our bodies, and in our homes. Sensors may gather data from the refrigerator or the heating system. They could also be located in city lampposts or attached to tree trunks. These non-traditional locations make physical security difficult or impossible to achieve. The devices should be manufactured to be resistant to tampering, and they should be placed so that they are not obvious and are very difficult to access.

**Lack of Upgradeability**

IoT sensor-enabled devices may be located in remote and/or inaccessible locations where human intervention or configuration is almost impossible. The devices are often designed to be in service many years longer than is typical for conventional high-tech equipment. Some IoT devices are intentionally designed without the ability to be upgraded, or they might be deployed in situations that make it difficult or impossible to reconfigure or upgrade. New vulnerabilities are uncovered all of the time. If a device is non-upgradeable, then the vulnerability will exist for the rest of its lifetime. If a device is upgradeable, the typical consumer may not have a technology background, therefore, the upgrade process should perform automatically or be easy enough to be performed by a layperson.
