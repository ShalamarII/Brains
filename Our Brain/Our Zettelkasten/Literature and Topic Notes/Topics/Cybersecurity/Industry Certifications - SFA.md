Industry certifications are highly respected by employers around the world and help validate the skills needed to launch successful careers in networking and IT. Certifications are achieved by passing an exam proctored by a certifying authority. Students must complete training materials specific to the certification exam. Field experience is often very helpful, but not always required, to pass a certification exam.

There are two basic types of certifications available: vendor-specific and vendor-neutral. Vendor-specific certifications are tailored to technologies offered by a company to prove that an individual is qualified to deploy and manage that technology. Vendor-neutral certifications are offered by many different organizations. They show that an individual has a well-rounded skillset centered on common systems and programs, rather than specific brands of technology.

Vendor-specific courses are available that prepare students for Cisco industry certifications. For example, training and other certification resources are available from the Cisco Learning Network.

Cisco certifications that are relevant to the IoT are the following:

- **Networking** - The Cisco Certified Network Administrator (CCNA) certification tests a candidate's knowledge and skills related to network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security fundamentals, and automation and programmability.
- **Security** - The Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate (CBROPS) certification tests skills and knowledge in security concepts, security monitoring, host-based analysis, network intrusion analysis, and security policies and procedures.
- **Automation** - The Cisco Certified DevNet Associate (DEVASC) certification assesses skills and knowledge in understanding and using APIs, Cisco platforms and development, application development and security, and infrastructure and automation.

Most often, certifications must be renewed over time. Requirements for re-certification may be earning continuing education units (CEUs), passing a re-certification exam, or both. CEUs can be earned by attending classes, professional membership, on-the-job experience, or research and publishing of materials that support the certification technology.
