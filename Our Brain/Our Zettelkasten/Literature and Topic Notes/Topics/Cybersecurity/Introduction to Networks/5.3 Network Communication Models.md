### 5.3.2 The Protocol Stack

TCP/IP Model

1. Application - HTTP/HTTPS - Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control.
2. Transport - TCP - Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks.
3. Internet - IP - Determines the best path through the network.
4. Network Access - Ethernet - Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network.

OSI Reference Model (Open Systems Interconnection Project)

7 - Application - Contains protocols used for process-to-process communications
6 - Presentation - Provides for common representation of the data transferred between application layer services (It translates application data into more readable PC information)
5 - Session - Provides services to the presentation layer to organize its dialogue and to manage data exchange.
4 - Transport - Defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data for individual communications between the end devices
3 - Network - Provides services to exchange the individual pieces of data over the network between identified end devices.
2 - Data Link - describes methods for exchanging data frames between devices over a common media.
1 - Physical - The physical layer protocols describe the mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural means to activate, maintain, and de-activate physical connections for a bit transmission to and from a network device.

### Differences

TCP/IP Model only shows what makes up itself, whereas OSI is for all models/communication.

The key similarities are in the transport and network layers; however, the two models differ in how they relate to the layers above and below each layer:

- OSI Layer 3, the network layer, maps directly to the TCP/IP internet layer. This layer is used to describe protocols that address and route messages through an internetwork.
- OSI Layer 4, the transport layer, maps directly to the TCP/IP transport layer. This layer describes general services and functions that provide ordered and reliable delivery of data between source and destination hosts.
- The TCP/IP application layer includes several protocols that provide specific functionality to a variety of end user applications. The OSI model Layers 5, 6, and 7 are used as references for application software developers and vendors to produce applications that operate on networks.
- Both the TCP/IP and OSI models are commonly used when referring to protocols at various layers. Because the OSI model separates the data link layer from the physical layer, it is commonly used when referring to these lower layers.
