When requesting a website (www.example.com):
- DHCP makes sure that the device has an IP address (What network it belongs to, default gateway, IP of the DNS Server.)
- The computer asks the DNS server for the IP address of the comain name.
- IP is used to deliver the packet.
- TCP guarantees reliability. It resends any packets that did not make it.
