 Protocols that govern successful human communication are these:

- An identified sender and receiver
- Agreed upon method of communicating (face-to-face, telephone, letter, photograph)
- Common language and grammar
- Speed and timing of delivery
- Confirmation or acknowledgment requirements

The techniques that are used in network communications share these fundamentals with human conversations.
