Routers do not forward broadcasts. An ARP request is one device requesting another devices Mac address.

The network locked behind a router is known as a Broadcast Domain.

When a host has no IPv4 address, it puts out a DHCP Discover message. This will also not be forwarded.

A router segments and separates layer to broadcast domains.
