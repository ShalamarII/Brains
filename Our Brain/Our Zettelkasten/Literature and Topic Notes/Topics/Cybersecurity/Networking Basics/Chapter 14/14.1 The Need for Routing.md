### Dividing the Local Network
##### Reasons to Divide the Network
- Broadcasts being received by too many devices.
- Security purposes

Broadcast Domain: The area that receives a broadcast.
Routers divide the network AND the broadcast domains (Separate networks)

Remote Hosts are devices outside our local network. To access these hosts, you need routing/routers. Routing is the process of identifying the best path to a destination.
