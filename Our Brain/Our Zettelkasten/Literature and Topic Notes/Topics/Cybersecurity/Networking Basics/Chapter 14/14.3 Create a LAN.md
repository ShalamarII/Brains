### Advantages of a Single Network
Less complexity, lower network cost
Allows devices to be "seen" by other devices
Faster data transfer - more direct communication
Ease of device access

### Disadvantages of a Single Network
- More traffic may begin to slow network performance
- Harder to implement Quality of Service (QoS)
- Harder to implement security

### Advantages of Multiple Networks
