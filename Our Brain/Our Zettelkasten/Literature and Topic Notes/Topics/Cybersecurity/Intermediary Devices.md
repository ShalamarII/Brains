### Switches
Switches segment networks. They filter and forward packets. They forward based on MAC addresses. Switches have many ports, and when data arrives at any port, the destination address is examined first and some checks are also done and then it is processed to the devices. Different types of communication are supported here like unicast, multicast, and broadcast communication.

### Router
Network device that forwards packets between different computer networks. Routers create the "path" between your pc and another pc. They are the most common device used.

### Hubs
Hubs are the "dumb" switches of intermediary devices.  They send all incoming data to every port without any filtering. Data on a network hub can "collide", destroying the data. The hub then sends info about the collision to each host and each sender must wait a certain amount of time.
