There are four basic characteristics that network architects must address:
- Fault Tolerance
- Scalability
- Quality of Service
- Security


Fault tolerance allows for the usage of a network, even when one or multiple links in the logical chain fail. Limiting the scale of failure is VERY important, as small interruptions can be tolerated, but large ones can be disastrous.
