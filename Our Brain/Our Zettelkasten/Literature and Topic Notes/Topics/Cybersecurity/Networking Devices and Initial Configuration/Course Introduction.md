This course teaches intermediate knowledge and skills for networking by covering the basic concepts and skills needed to build a home office network and a small Cisco office network. The learner is presented with an engaging and exploratory view of networks, the devices that comprise them, how they work, and troubleshooting tools and techniques. It prepares the learner to move into Cybersecurity or DevNet by going deeper into Ethernet, IP Addressing and the transport layer. It also covers Cisco device configuration and ends with the ability to configure and troubleshoot a small Cisco network. The goal of this course is to provide the learner with an intermediate overview of network design, structure, and operations. Upon completion of the Network Devices and Initial Configuration course, students will be able to perform the following tasks:

- Explain components of a hierarchical network design.
- Explain the characteristics of virtualization and cloud services.
- Calculate numbers between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal systems.
- Explain how Ethernet operates in a switched network.
- Explain how routers use network layer protocols and services to enable end-to-end connectivity.
- Calculate an IPv4 subnetting scheme to efficiently segment a network.
- Explain how ARP enables communication on a local area network.
- Explain how DNS and DHCP services operate.
- Compare the operations of transport layer protocols in supporting end-to-end communication.
- Use the Cisco IOS.
- Build a simple computer network using Cisco devices.
- Use various tools to test network connectivity
