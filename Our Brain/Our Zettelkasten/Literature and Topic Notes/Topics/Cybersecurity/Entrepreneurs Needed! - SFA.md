The IoT is also creating a demand for a new kind of IT specialist. These are individuals with the knowledge and skillsets to develop new IoT-enabled products and process the data they collect.

An entrepreneurial workforce is needed that specializes in both information science and software or computer engineering.

Additionally, operational technologies and information technologies are converging in the IoT. With this convergence, people must collaborate and learn from each other to understand the things, the networks, and methodologies that harness the limitless potential of the IoT.
