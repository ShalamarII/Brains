- Every 2 weeks we go on a date<br>    <br>- Every 2 months we get out of the house [hotel, etc. (Staycation)]<br>    <br>- Every 2 years we go on a big trip<br>    <br><br>This is a baseline; we can do more in any given time period<br><br>In less financially feasible moments,  <br>- Dates can be at home (as long as it’s purposeful, 1 on 1 in a romantic context)  <br>-  Staycations can be in nearby vicinity  <br>-  Big trips could be at home, but take time off & pamper ourselves
