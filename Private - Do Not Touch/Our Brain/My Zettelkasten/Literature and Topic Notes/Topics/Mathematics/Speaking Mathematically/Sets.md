A set is a collection of given elements (This can be anything, it's useful to think of them intuitively.)

[[Private - Do Not Touch/Our Brain/My Zettelkasten/Literature and Topic Notes/Topics/Mathematics/Speaking Mathematically/Set-Roster Notation]] is the notation used when speaking of a given set.

 Some sets are so commonly referred to that they are given special symbolic names.
 
|  Symbolic Names |  Sets |
| -------- | -------- |  
| R | All real numbers |  
| Z | All integers |
| Q | The set of all rational numbers|

Superscripting +, -, or nonneg indicates that only positive, negative, or non-negative numbers are to be included. R<sup>+</sup> is the set of all positive real numbers.

The set of all real numbers is commonly pictured on a line. The real number line is considered *continuous* because it is not imagined to have any holes. 

The set of integers is a collection of points on the real number line. Therefore, every integer is also a real number, and because all of them have separation, the set of integers is considered *discrete*. 

The name *discrete mathematics* comes from the distinction of *continuous* and *discrete* mathematical objects.

Another way to specify a set is called the [[Private - Do Not Touch/Our Brain/My Zettelkasten/Literature and Topic Notes/Topics/Mathematics/Speaking Mathematically/Set-Builder Notation]].
