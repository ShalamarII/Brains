The word algorithms was largely unknown in the middle of the twentieth century, yet now it is one of the first words encountered in the study of computer science. To solve a problem on a computer, it is necessary to find an algorithm, or step-by-step sequence of instructions, for the computer to follow. Designing an algorithm requires an understanding of the mathematics underlying the problem to be solved. Determining whether or on an algorithm is correct requires a sophisticated use of mathematical induction. Calculating the amount of time or memory space the algorithm will need in order to compare it to other algorithms that output the same product requires knowledge of combinatorics, recurrence relations, functions, and Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta notations.
