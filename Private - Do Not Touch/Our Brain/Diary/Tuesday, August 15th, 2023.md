Today is the first day using my new brain. I am excited at the prospect of it, and hoping it helps me with productivity. I am going to section each diary post into 3 sections: Today I Learned, Today I Listened, Today I Accomplished, How I Feel, and my Healthiness Checklist.

## Today I Learned
	Today I learned about polyphasic sleep, which has a core of 6 hours, and 2 20 minute naps throughout the day! I would like to try this out in the upcoming days, as it lines up well with my work schedule. I also learned about Reader Tablets, which are meant to assist in reading books. They have a variety of features meant for ease of reading, and I'm considering purchasing one of them. I also learned about "Dumbphones", which are phones without regular apps like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook. I think this could be a good option for me in the future so as to avoid being on my phone.

## Today I Accomplished
	Today I took my meds and cleaned my desk off!
