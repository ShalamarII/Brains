## How I Feel
	Morning: Polyphasic sleep is real fun I won't lie, the extra time for use feels amazing. I hope I'm not too late to go to college. If I am I'll have to pick something else up; a job most likely.
	Night: I got Jon to play Skullgirls a bit, and he DEFINITELY liked it. I might be able to get him to play it on his own :D
