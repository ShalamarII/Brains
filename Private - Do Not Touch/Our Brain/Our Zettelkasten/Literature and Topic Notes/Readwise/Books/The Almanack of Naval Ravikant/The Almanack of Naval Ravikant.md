## Naval's Principles of Wealth
How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky)
1.  Seek Wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.
2.  Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will avoid you.
3.  Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.
4.  You are not going to get rich renting out your own time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.
5.  You will get rich by giving society what it wants to get but does not yet know how to get; at scale.
6.  Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.
7.  The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.
8.  Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge come from compound interest.
9.  Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy and above all, integrity.
10. Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.
11. Learn to Sell. Learn to Build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
12. Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability and leverage.
13. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion whether than whatever is hot right now.
14. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.
15. Specific knowledge is taught in apprenticeships, not schools.
16. Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.
17. Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.
18. "Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I will move the earth." - Archimedes.
19. Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
20. Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgement.
21. Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don't waste your life chasing it.
22. Capitol and Labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capitol, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
23. Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
24. An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.
25. If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.
26. Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.
27. Judgement requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.
28. There is no skill called "Business". Avoid business magazines and business classes. 
29. Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics and computers.
30. Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.
31. You should be too busy to "do coffee" while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.
32. Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.
33. Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.
34. Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining this until this is true. 
35. There are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone else getting rich off of you.
36. Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.
37. When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day.
38. Summary: Productize yourself.


## Wealth Vs Money.
 - Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is an IOU society gives us for providing value.
 - Wealth is businesses and assets that can earn wealth while you sleep.

### Technology is something that doesn't quite work yet. When it works it is no longer technology.

#### To become wealthy, figure out what technology you can provide for society. Then you have to scale it.

### Escape competition through authenticity.
 - When you are competing with someone, it's because you are copying them.
