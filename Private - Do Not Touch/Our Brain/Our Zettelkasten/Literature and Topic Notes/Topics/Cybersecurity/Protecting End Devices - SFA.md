End devices are the source or destination for data that is sent over the network. End devices are any user device, such as computers, tablets, or phones. They are also devices that users access or send data to, such as servers and printers.

Following are some common ways to secure end devices:

**Keep the Firewall On**

Whether it is a software firewall or a hardware firewall on a router, the firewall should be turned on and updated to prevent hackers from accessing your personal or company data.

**Manage Your Operating System and Browser**

Hackers are always trying to take advantage of vulnerabilities in your operating systems and your web browsers. To protect your computer and your data, set the security settings on your computer and browser at medium or higher. Update your computerâ€™s operating system including your web browsers and regularly download and install the latest software patches and security updates from the vendors.

**Use Antivirus and Antispyware**

Malicious software, such as viruses, Trojan horses, worms, ransomware and spyware, are installed on your computing devices without your permission, in order to gain access to your computer and your data. Viruses can destroy your data, slow down your computer, or take over your computer. Only download software from trusted websites to avoid getting viruses and spyware in the first place. Antivirus software is designed to scan your computer and incoming email for viruses and delete them. Sometimes antivirus software also includes antispyware. Keep your software up to date to protect your computer from the newest malicious software.

**Protect All Your Devices**

Your computing devices, whether they are routers, PCs, laptops, tablets, or smartphones, should be password protected to prevent unauthorized access. The stored information should be encrypted, especially for sensitive or confidential data. For mobile devices, only store necessary information, in case these devices are stolen or lost when you are away from your home. If any one of your devices is compromised, the criminals may have access to all your data through your cloud-storage service provider, such as iCloud or Google drive.
