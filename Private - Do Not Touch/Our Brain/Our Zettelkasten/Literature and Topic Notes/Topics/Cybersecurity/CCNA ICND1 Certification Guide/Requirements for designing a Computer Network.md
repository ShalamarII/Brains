### Types of Computer Networks
There are 4 main types:

##### PAN - Personal Area Network
This is a network within your personal reach, often connected over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It is also called a HAN (Home Area). PANs are dominated by portable devices. 

##### LAN - Local Area Network
This covers the same area as a PAN, but mainly consists of fixed devices. LAN is organized around a location, where PAN is organized around a person.
##### MAN - Metropolitan Area Network
A man is a group of LANs connected in the boundary of a city or town.

##### WAN -  Wide Area Network
Areas that are not covered by LAN or MAN are covered by a WAN. WAN is a network that covers a large geographic area using dedicated telecommunication lines such as telephone lines, leased lines, or satellites. Even though ti covers a large area, it does not have geographic restrictions based on their physical reach. WAN's are made up of PANs, LANs and MANs.
