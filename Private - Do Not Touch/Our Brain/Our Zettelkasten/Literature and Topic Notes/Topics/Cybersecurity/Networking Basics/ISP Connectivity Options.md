### ISP Services
ISP links your home network and the internet. ISP's can be a local cable provider, the cell network for your phone, or an independent provider that leases bandwidth on the physical network of another company.

ISP's do not only provide internet access. They may provide VOIP, Web Hosting, FTP Hosting, Technical Support, POP Internet Access, and more.

ISP's are critical to communications across the internet. Each ISP connects to other ISPs to form a network that connects users all over the world.

The primary thing that connects the backbone of the internet is fiber-optic cable. It is installed mainly underground and underwater.

### ISP Connections
ISPs have a complex web of fiber-optic cables with expensive switches and routers that direct the flow of information between source and destination hosts (End Devices). Routers are necessary to securely connect to an ISP. 

### Cable and DSL Connections
Most people do not connect to their network using fiber optic. It is most often utilizing cable (Same as TV Line) or a DSL connection (Digital Subscriber Line). 

Cable provides high bandwidth and is always on. A cable modem separates the signal from the other signals carried on the cable.

DSL also provides a high bandwidth and is always on. DSL needs a special high-speed modem that separates the DSL signal from the telephone signal. DSL runs over a telephone line. This is a 3 channel method (Telephone calls, Download, Upload.) The quality and speed mainly depends on the phone line and the distance from the central office of the phone company.

### Additional Connectivity Options
Cellular - This uses a cellular network to connect to the internet. Wherever you can get a cell signal, you can get cellular internet access. Performance is mostly limited by the phone and cell tower.

Satellite - Dishes are used to send a signal from a satellite. This needs a clear line of sight, and can be poor in high wooded places or in places with overhead obstructions.

Dial-Up - The user calls an ISP access phone number, and it sends information. This has the lowest speed and should only be considered when no other options are available.
