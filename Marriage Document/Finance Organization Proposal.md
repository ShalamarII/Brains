Account for Holding / Spending (the account we initially deposit into, and then hold the money in until we divvy it up for bills- what’s left is for spending, although we intend to budget that too)

Account for Bills - Bills that can be autopaid, and bills that we have to pay manually (Kept track of in an Excel sheet/Equivalent)

Account for Savings (Pooling money towards a goal - Snowball method preferably?)

Emergency Fund (1000 dollars in it at any given time.)

----

No dipping into other funds, even if you know more money is on the way. Spending is for spending!

50$ in cash minimum on each of our persons’ at any given moment (in case the card doesn’t work, etc.)

Do we want to Tithe: yes
