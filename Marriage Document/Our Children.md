We want: 
- Two children (We want biological kids preferably)

- To have them once we are financially stable

- To raise them into functional adults but love them regardless.

- To have them after marriage so our parents don’t kill us (nuh uh)

- Them to be able to meet all of their extended family (within reasonable bounds)

- To raise them bilingually

- To teach them about emotional intelligence, alongside other types of intelligence, being examples of the principles we teach.

- If a reason to adopt occurs, we can have that conversation then :) 

- If we claim something (ex. give a timeframe for something), we need to keep it and own up to it (ex. No dating until 16)

- gaming standards

- Give them good morals 👍

- No “nuh-uh”ing or “I’m the parent” in response to good arguments

- Precursory idea; not letting the kids stay out too many consecutive days, with weekends being exceptions

- Allowance system to account/fund
