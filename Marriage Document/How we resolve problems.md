Step 1: When we disagree, get naked.

Step 2: Take the necessary steps to resolve the issue

Step 3: Take some time with each other.

**- If a past issue is still causing a grudge when we thought it was resolved, we have to revisit it. It should not reappear in present issues if we can help it.

- Either of us (or even both) are allowed to request a “time out” before we discuss any given issue, in order to let any intense emotions cool out. However, it is not allowed to use this as an avoidance tactic.

- We are not allowed to interrupt each other when speaking, and we are allowed to tell the other person if they interrupted us.

- After we discuss a resolution to the issue, we will write out a plan for going forward- steps we will be taking to resolve/prevent the issue from resurfacing. We will write current ones on a google doc, and catalogue/archive “completed” plans on paper.**

- If either of us ask why the other is mad/sad/etc., we will not be petty- we will answer honestly, instead of saying “You should know” or “I told you so” (Basically, we just have to actually explain why)
	- (Side effect of this; When we’re disagreeing playfully for no other reason than to be suggestive, we’ll have to be honest about our “ulterior” motives)**

- In “quick time events” situations, where we can’t have an in-depth discussion beforehand, the person that agrees with the morally/ethically-problematic take will have to abstain, and then we will discuss it later. (Highly unlikely, but established to be preventative)


- No matter what the circumstance, no yelling at each other.

- “We are human”

- Hear both logical and emotional viewpoint right after each other



## Summary (in bullet points);

- No grudges

- Time outs can be used before discussions (to cool off)

- Not allowed to be used as an avoidance tactic

- No interrupting each other when it’s our turn to speak

- Allowed to tell the other person if they interrupted you

- Write a plan for going forward after each issue is resolved

- Archiving/Cataloging past plans that have been “completed”

- Reflecting on plans each months

- We have to actually honestly explain why we’re upset, even if we’ve been asked more than once

- (This causes a fun side effect when we’re being flirty lol)

- When we are unable to discuss an issue at the moment;

- The less problematic stance will be applied

- Discussion will be held later

- In less problematic situations, veto’s apply

- No matter the circumstance, no yelling at each other

- Always need to remember we’re both human

- We must both state our logical and emotion view points on the issue
