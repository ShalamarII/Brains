|Name|Rico|Veronica|
|Religion|At Base: Christian ~ Non-denominational.<br><br>---<br><br>    I have no qualms with the biblical standpoint of others, merely looking towards the original texts, historically, socially, and culturally for context. I am very much of the mind that without such aspects, we cannot get as close to the full picture as possible (despite others having differing opinions). I recognize the importance of religion in a relationship, and especially in marriage, as two bonded under The Lord.|(Current) label: Roman Catholic<br><br>---<br><br>   I celebrate Roman Catholic traditions and celebrations, but in truth, my belief leans the most towards non-denominational. I believe that God exists, even if our characterization of them could be off. I try to follow what I have been taught is ‘correct’ in roman catholicism “just in case”, but truthfully I believe in finding meaning/purpose in our lives and being kind throughout it, and learning about the afterlife/if there is an afterlife once we get to it. However, I do not try to discredit other religious beliefs as I have no way of knowing which is the “true” one, which I am currently at peace with.|
|Politics|Definitely closer to liberal over anything, but I am not exclusively one party or one person's “guy”.|Don’t know any of the terminology for politics, but I doubt I fall under one ‘party’.<br><br>I’m pretty sure I lean more towards the left/liberal, mainly because of my prioritization of human wellbeing and quality of life over financial gains and bigger leaps in innovation.|
|Social|Friend good, friend great, friend is we appreciate|yes|
|Relationship|Veronica on my head cuz she on my mind, Veronica on my bed cuz I sleep wit her, Veronica on my chest, cuz my heart wit her. We grow together regardless of happiness  or sadness. We are the greatest team except that one time when she said we was gon have phone sex at 9 o’ clock. She was plattin’ me yo. Being fake asl on da lo’. But, she did try twerking for me, so that makes up for it ez. I owe her some head for that fr fr.|The idea of being ‘equal’ partners is the most important aspect of a romantic relationship to me. Acknowledgement from both sides that we both value and love each other is the best!! <br><br>Intellectual compatibility cannot be undermined. Loving and supporting each other in the purest ways possible is AWESOME and I LOVE IT<br><br>I LOVE RODRICO AND HE LOVES ME BACK!!!!!![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bMzcMXnZXqMbEElvjbBhDOg3YBvQDDFTbwIqU2LlMnjjvgCq5IYW9N4XuFc2GaMvfKOFz9MSTVkpUQqPjpKEZFV8qojecpcrL9jobEkk16oBNe5KcHiq70dgXZDPzaWQaXq8xKFJ65NeJJPpGzIQVA)|
|Moral|Deontology 🙂|TBA (leaning towards deontology, not quite that though)|
|Culture|I plan to share African-American heritage (as soon as I figure out what that is in specific.) Other culture-wise, I wasn’t really raised with any of my other “blood” in mind, so I don’t really know what to do about that. Our kids will only be half of my half, which means they’ll be:<br><br>Polish - 50%<br><br>African-American: 14.5%<br><br>French Creole: 18.75%<br><br>Japanese: 10.5%<br><br>Blackfoot Native American: 6.25%<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>Super mixed ah kids, so I think Idfk what to do with them fr. Obviously Polish and African-American, but should I even explore the other “portions”.|Wanna share Polish culture as much as possible :) <br><br>FOOD FUSIONS YES PLEASE<br><br>If possible, I intend to raise our future children with as many aspects of Polish culture as possible.  <br>🎉<br><br>POLYCULTURALISM WOO 🎉<br><br>Depending on where we end up living, might end up sprinkling some canadian-isms in there too.|
|Financial|Not really opinionated on this, I think we use the money for what we need, and then decide what to do with the extra money accordingly. Planning-wise, we should VERY much budget and things. Being transparent is very important to me about our finances, for sure. We should never have to sneak around each other’s back about money, as we are a team!|Too much excess isn’t needed; the amount that constitutes “excess” is obviously relative to the economy, but anything that lets us live in comfort and lets us travel and/or spend money on others is good. So excess, in my definition, is basically if we became rich rich and started hoarding for no reason.<br><br>Savings are great though, even if not for a concrete cause yet.<br><br>I believe communication is also key here, and that we can trust each other to be honest about how we’d like to use our money. Like Rico said, we should never have to sneak around each other’s back about money. <br><br>Say in finances is 50-50 (as we are a team!)<br><br>(Shared accounts while living together is most likely the move- we both agree with it, but we gotta see how it works in practice)|
|Property|Mi casa es su casa (We can discuss things LOL) If you’d like something specifically to yourself, just mention and say that LOL. I’ll respect the boundary.|Mi casa es su casa!  <br>(I bring in whatever I feel like bringing when we move in together, and from that point on we share it :) )  <br>We discuss anything we want to do with shared items, relative to perceived value.<br><br>When in doubt, communicate!<br><br>You are not obligated to share things you would prefer to keep for yourself, so also feel free to just mention it- I’ll also respect the boundary.|
|Surprises|Surprises are great, but feeling obligated to surprise me ruins the fun of it. Therefore, do not feel pressured to surprise me, and tell me [PLEASE] if you don’t want to 🙂|Surprises are nice, but not needed for me either! Surprises are pretty ingrained in me due to cultural customs, but I don’t believe they’re worth doing if they cause stress or burden for either the gifter or the giftee.|
